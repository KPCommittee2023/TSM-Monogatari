Chapter 3: The Moon Prince [Esmeray]

[Radio Club Basic + Printer + Mic + Laptop]
[Esmeray's BGM]

Narration:
It's been a couple of days since Skye joined the group.

The Radio Club is now livelier than ever, much to Kyo's playful dismay, as you, Atria, and Skye chat loudly and often in the club room.

Now, all you need is one more member to make the club official. But who?

[Transition to School Hallway Day]

Narration:
As you're deep in thought and walking down the hallways of ILUNA Academy, you snap to attention when you hear loud giggles, flirts, and cheers coming from a crowd in front of you.

[Esmeray (Amused) Appears on Screen, labeled as ???]

In the center of the crowd is a tall dude with dark turquoise hair, lots of black and shiny bling, and pretty turquoise-gold eyes.

Some of the people in the crowd have signs in their hands.

"We love you, Esmeray!" says the one in the hands of an enthusiastically cheering girl.

"The Prince of the Dark Moon, and my heart <3" says another in the hands of a tall, totally smitten boy.

The person in the center winks at the two of them, a lax smile on his face as he does so.

The two start squealing before the girl faints in the boy's arms, making him drop his sign.

Player:
	That must be the popular guy of the school I heard about. Esmeray Regulus, I think?

Narration:
	You don't really pay too much attention to the crowd. If anything, it's a little annoying.

The bell rings, meaning most students will be late to their class if they don't get going, including yourself.

Student:
	See you later, Esmeray!

Narration:
	You walk past the crowd, hearing Esmeray laugh at the random person and wave at them.

	You slow down your pace. Something about that laugh is weird.

	You turn around, looking closely at Esmeray.

	Sure enough, although Esmeray's face is smiling, his eyes look empty.

	You move so that you're partially hidden by a nearby trash can, continuing to observe Esmeray.

[Esmeray Unamused]

Once the crowd is gone, you see Esmeray's smile fall, and his entire face becomes cold. He then starts trudging to his class.

	Your eyes widen at what you've just seen, but your thoughts will have to wait. You're late to class!

[Transition to Hallway BG]
[No Sprites]

Narration:
The day is finally over, and you're heading to the Radio Club. You need to strategize with Kyo on how to gain your last member.

	On your way there, you hear the faint sounds of guitar chords accompanied by a muffled voice.

Player:
I shouldn't peek… I'm a little busy…

Narration:
But your curiosity is winning today.

Quietly, you walk towards the source of the noise.

As you get closer, the guitar chord sounds morph into a soft melody, and with it the muffled voice is now distinct and clear.

The voice leads you to the entrance of an empty classroom, door slightly ajar, enough to hear the song.

The lovely tenor voice makes you almost breathless. You have to see who's making that song.

You creep up closer to the crack of the door and carefully pull it wider. Your eyes open in shock.

[Esmeray CG]

Esmeray:
	Don't need the plastic smiles all up in my face
	Just wanna be a moonchild and stay in outer space~

	Don't wanna keep on going on like this
	These people all really like to miss
	The fact that I don't care…
	A fact that they can't bear…
	
	…

	…Someday I will travel far
	Riding on a shooting star
	Leaving won't give me a scar
Cause all I need is me and my guitar~!

[END CG]

Esmeray ()
[Generic Classroom background]

Narration:
	You're in awe, to say the least.

Who would've thought that the school's resident popular guy is also a musical talent?

Player:
	…How amazing would it be if he joined the Radio Club?

…Yeah! Wouldn't he be a good person to arrange music to broadcast? His voice is perfect!

…

Should I try to invite him?

[Proceed to two choices: <Knock and try to invite Esmeray> or <Don't knock and invite Esmeray>]

[Choice 1: Knock and try to invite Esmeray to the Club]

Narration:
You take a deep breath and knock quietly before walking into the classroom.

[Esmeray Unamused]

Esmeray immediately stops playing, his face loses its smile, and he turns to you with a cold face.

[Scene reconverges here]

[Choice 2: Don't Knock and invite Esmeray]

Narration:
You hesitate in asking Esmeray to join.

He's very high profile! Why would he want to join a club that no one knows about?

While you were deliberating, you accidentally shuffle in place, bumping into the classroom's door.

*CREAK* [Door creak SFX]

[Esmeray Unamused]

Quickly, Esmeray stops playing, his face loses its smile, and he turns to the door with a cold face.

You laugh awkwardly, before slowly entering the room.
[Scene reconverges here]

Player:
	…Hey! That's some amazing playing, you're really talented!

Esmeray: 
…

Player:
So, I, uh, I'm part of the Radio Club, and we're currently recruiting members. I think you'd be an amazing fit for it!

So, what do you say? Would you like to join the Radio Club?

Esmeray [Angry]:
	…Hah! As if I'd join your club. 

Nah, if it's full of eavesdroppers like you, then hell, I definitely don't want to be in any part of it.

[Esmeray sprite disappears]

Narration:
Esmeray walks out, leaving you speechless and watching his shrinking figure as he walks down the hallway.

Gone was the smile from before.

[Proceed to next scene]

[School Hallway Day]
[Esmeray Neutral]

Narration:
The next day, you spot Esmeray in the hallway on the way to the Radio Club. Luckily, he was alone.

Although he rejected you last time, you won't give up!

You know that with his talent in music, he would definitely be a great addition to the club.

He is a hidden gem! Not only could he use his talent in music to compose soundtracks for the club, but his voice also fits that of a charming broadcaster perfectly.

And, who knows? He could be as good a friend as Atria, Skye, or Kyo.

With conviction, you decide that this moment in the hallway would be a good time to try and get him to join the Radio Club.

You try to get his attention and wave at him.

Player:
Esmeray!

Esmeray [Unamused]: 
…

[Footstep SFX]
[Esmeray sprite disappears]
[Hallway BG]

Narration:
You sigh, thinking you'll try again.

You wish Kyo was with you, but you couldn't find him anywhere, and you don't have his phone number.

It's at times like this where frustration is high that you wish you could contact him, but this frustration is overtaken by your realization that really you haven't seen him much these past couple of days.

Where is he?


*BLACK SCREEN TRANSITION*
[Transition to School Hallway Day]
[Esmeray Neutral]

Narration:
After gym class, as you walk to the restroom, you find Esmeray walking out from the unisex restroom door.

You try waving at him again, but before you can get within a 10 foot radius of his location, he swiftly walks away in the other direction.

[Esmeray Sprite Disappears]

Groaning, you just go into the restroom.

*BLACK SCREEN TRANSITION*
[Transition to School Hallway Day]

Narration:
A couple days have passed since you first tried to get Esmeray into the Radio Club, each day being met with more glares and avoidance from Esmeray.

Kyo, on the few days you would see him, just made fun of you. Whenever you got irritated and asked him where he had been, he'd change the subject or say he had things going on at home.

You would just huff in response and walk with him to the Radio Club classroom.

As if receiving Kyo's lack of help wasn't enough, you also dealt with more people trying to accuse Skye of the increasing incidences of vandalism going on, as well as Atria's old friends lurking around and glaring at your club.

[Skye_Default and Atria2_Nervous]

Skye:
	Tch, they're just jealous they don't have what we have, right y'all?

Narration:
	Skye gestures to you, Atria, and the air next to her while walking down the halls.

	Atria looks around.

Although they're a lot less intimidated of their friends than before, they're still cautious while walking down the halls with you, Kyo, and Skye.

Speaking of Kyo, he's not here, AGAIN. He did tell you that he had a lot of work going on lately, but if the Radio Club's one of his major commitments, how important must those other things be?

Atria:
	W-Well, it seems like we're close to the club room! By the way, w-were we able to 
register officially yet?

Player:
	We still need one more member, I think. That's what Kyo told me, anyways.

Skye:
	Mm mm, I see. How's he, by the way? He seems to not be around lately.

Player:
	*Sigh* I don't know, Skye…

Narration:
	There is silence between you three, until Atria clears their throat.

Atria [Atria2_Timid]:
	So, who… who are we trying to recruit?

Narration:
	Skye and Atria turn to you, curiosity shining on their faces.

	You sheepishly grin at them.

Player:
	Uh… have you heard of Esmeray Regulus?

Narration:
	Atria's and Skye's eyes widen in shock.

Atria and Skye:
	WHAT?!

Atria [Atria2_Nervous]:
T-That really, r-really high profile person?! The so-called charming f-boy of the school who's so handsome no one really cares if he flirts with everyone?!

Skye:
	Why would he want to join us? Can we even trust him?

Player:
	Hold on, y'all. I haven't brought him in yet. I'm just thinking about bringing him.

	There are some reasons…

Narration:
	You pause.

	You don't know if it's okay to share with them about Esmeray being a musical talent yet.

	It'd be best to get his consent first.

Player:
A-Anyways, I think he would fit right in. If– I mean, when I bring him in, you'll see why. Can you trust me?

Narration:
	With some hesitation, they both nod at you.

	Atria has a wary smile on their face, while Skye pushes up her glasses.

	You smile, happy to have them as your friends.

Player:
	Thanks, y'all.

*BLACK SCREEN TRANSITION*
[School Hallway Day]

Narration:
Although you said that you would bring Esmeray to them, it's proving to be harder than you thought.

It's been a couple of days since you told Atria and Skye to trust you. You were at the point of giving up on pursuing Esmeray, and going back to Atria and Skye in defeat.

Before you do so, you decide to trudge up the steps that lead to the rooftop, hoping to just have a quiet lunch.

As you get closer to the door of the rooftop, you hear the sound of familiar singing.

When you get to the slightly open door (Again?? You think to yourself.), you stop and peek through the crack, only to see Esmeray sitting on a bench as he sways to the melody he is singing.

[Transition to Rooftop Day]
[Esmeray Genuine]

Esmeray:
What if I could fly to the blue sugar sky?
Wouldn't that be sweet
…
Don't wanna deal with a lie
Just wanna move to the rhythm of the beat

If only they could see…
I just wanna go far
That could be my remedy
…
But all I got is me and my guitar…

Narration:
	Esmeray continues to sing and hum, while you start to think.

	How long has it been since you started trying to get him to join the club?

	If you go to him now, would it make a difference?

Player:
	Should I… have one more go?
	
[Proceed to three choices: <Invite Esmeray to the club> or <Hesitate> or <Turn around and go back down the stairs>]

[Choice 1: Invite Esmeray to the Club]

Narration:
You remember how it went the last time you had found Esmeray sitting alone and singing to himself, as well as the stinging rejection that came with it.

But, you also remember the friends you made along the way, and the benefits of having Esmeray in the club.

Like last time, you take a deep breath before pushing open the door to the rooftop boldly.

*CREAK* [Door creak SFX]

[Esmeray Neutral]

Esmeray stops singing and turns to the door, only to make eye contact with you.

[Esmeray Unamused]

He immediately stops smiling. There's a long pause as Esmeray stares at you long and hard.

But, rather than pushing you away for the umpteenth time, he rolls his eyes and shifts to the side, making room for you to sit next to him.

Your eyes widen, but you don't want to let go of this opportunity, and go and sit next to him.

[Scene reconverges here]

[Choice 2: Hesitate]

You remember how it went the last time you had found Esmeray sitting alone and singing to himself, as well as the stinging rejection that came with it.

What would be the difference now?

Sure, you pestered him the last couple of days so maybe he'll consider it.

But what if he doesn't?

While deliberating and waving your arms around, trying to make a plan, your thoughts distract you so much to the point that you accidentally hit the door wide open.

*CREAK* [Door creak SFX]

[Esmeray Neutral]

Esmeray stops singing and turns to the door, only to make eye contact with you.

[Esmeray Unamused]

He immediately stops smiling. There's a long pause. You can hardly breathe as Esmeray stares at you long and hard.

But, rather than pushing you away for the umpteenth time, he rolls his eyes and shifts to the side, making room for you to sit next to him.

Your eyes widen, but you don't want to let go of this opportunity, and go and sit next to him.

[Scene reconverges here]

[Choice 3: Turn around and Go Back Down the Stairs]

Narration:
You remember how it went the last time you had found Esmeray sitting alone and singing to himself, as well as the stinging rejection that came with it.

You remember how tiring it was to have the courage to face Esmeray and invite him over and over, only for him to brush you off.

Maybe this was the time to finally give up.

Thinking so, you turn around, getting ready to go down the stairs again.

...Unfortunately for you, you turn so quickly that your elbow slams into the door, making it creak loudly as it swings wide open.

*CREAK* [Door creak SFX]

[Esmeray Neutral]

Esmeray stops singing and turns to the door, only to make eye contact with you.

[Esmeray Unamused]

He immediately stops smiling. There's a long pause. You can hardly breathe as Esmeray stares at you long and hard.

Player:
	Is he gonna push me away again?...

Narration:
But, rather than pushing you away for the umpteenth time, he rolls his eyes and shifts to the side, making room for you to sit next to him.

Your eyes widen, but you don't want to let go of this opportunity, and go and sit next to him.
[Scene reconverges here]

Player:
 …Hi, Esmeray.

[Esmeray Neutral]

Narration:
Esmeray nods, looking down at the lunch in his lap and shifting the food around with the fork absentmindedly.

Player:
…

Esmeray:
…

Player: 
So–

Esmeray: 
Why me?

Narration:
You pause as Esmeray looks at you with a blank face.

Player: 
Excuse me?

Esmeray: 
Why me? Don't you have, like, other friends? What about those multicolored-haired weirdos– I mean, friends in your club already?

Narration:
He pauses.

You side-eye Esmeray.

He looks blankly back at you.

Player:
	I heard that.

Esmeray:
	Nah, you didn't.

Narration:
	You playfully glare at him before turning to your own lunch and shifting in your seat.

Player:
	I'll be blunt. I just think you would make a good addition to the club.

Narration [Esmeray Unamused]:
Esmeray raises his eyebrow at you in disbelief, and his eyes look at you as if asking you, "Seriously?"

Player:
Not only are you very talented in music – which would be helpful to use whenever we do broadcasts – but I think your presence alone would be good publicity for the club.

Narration:
	Esmeray scoffs at this, but continues to listen regardless.

Player:
	And also, I would like to be friends with you. You seem interesting, and nicer than you 
show. Although, you need to fix that playboy personality of yours.

Esmeray [Amused]:
	Pfft–

Narration:
You quickly turn to Esmeray in disbelief, only to find his face contorted into a laughing, genuine smile.

Esmeray:
	Playboy? Me? Nah, das crazy, what do you mean?

Like, I thought that's how you're supposed to act when you want to make friends?

Narration:
	Now it's your turn to laugh.

Player:
Hah, what? Really? You really thought the best way to socialize with people was to rizz them up? HAHA, that's HILARIOUS!

Esmeray [Teeth Smile]:
	Wh-WHAT?! NO! I was NOT– rizzing ANYONE! You're just weird to interpret it that way!

Narration:
	You two continue to laugh and talk more on the rooftop.

After you finish laughing, you look past the iron fence of the rooftop and at the sky.

[Esmeray Genuine]

Player:
The sky does look like blue sugar.

Narration [Esmeray Neutral]:
	Esmeray's eyes widen, and he whips his head towards you.

Esmeray:
H-Huh?

Player:
I overheard you singing earlier, and also before…

…Wanna talk about it? 

I-I mean, you don't have to, of course!

I was just thinking, I mean, we are friends now, so…

B-But of course, you don't have to, a-and if you want to then feel free to take all the time you need, and stuff…

Esmeray: 
	…

	…

F…friends?

…

Okay, I do want to say this to someone, at least…

Narration:
You patiently wait for him to keep talking.

After a couple moments of silence, Esmeray clears his throat.

Esmeray:
Ahem… When…… when I was in elementary school, I had a lot of people who thought I was like an alien because I was shorter than the average height and had weird looking ears.

	And s-so, in middle school, I decided to change things up a bit.

	Grew my hair out, changed my style, learned how to accessorize.

I learned about social cues, read some comics, watched some movies where the main character undergoes a transformation and suddenly they know how to talk to people, and how to get them to like them.

	So, I tried some of the lines from the movies and comics out.

	A-And it worked! People… They started to like me.

	My growth spurt helped me out too – I stood out from the crowd, in a good way.

All of a sudden, people stopped calling me names like alien boy, weirdo, and bozo, and they called me things like a prince, a cool guy.

	…

	And I liked it, my changes.

	And I thought it would stay that way, but…

Player:
	…

Esmeray:
	So, I started going out with some people.

At first, it was crazy to me: people actually liked me, I was actually someone attractive to them. My ways of communication were working, and stuff. 

	Like, whoa, intimate connection? Me?

And it was okay, but like, some people ended up ending our relationship because I wasn't who they thought I was.

	I mean, who wanted a dinosaur-loving, closeted emo-musician guy?

	But others gave me hope!

There was a guy I went out with, and he really appreciated me. I felt seen, and loved, genuinely. For the first time in a while.

	We ended up breaking it off because he said his parents were strict.

	Or at least, that's what he said to my face.

	…

Player:
	…

Esmeray [Angry]:
…Turns out he was making fun of me to his friends the entire time we were dating. I found out because this girl I knew showed me a video of him talking to her and their other friends.

I was heartbroken, angry… I mean, how could he blatantly lie to me like that and still be okay? Why… Why was I left with all the negatives?

Narration:
You begin to pat Esmeray on the back, seeing him so sad and agitated. He calms down, thanking you quietly.

Esmeray [Neutral]:
*inhale* Anyways, that girl and I ended up getting close because she told me about how she left the friend group and she was there for me.

	I healed, and then I thought that maybe she was the one, ya know?

Esmeray [Angry]:
	But then, it went to shit.

This girl, she was really toxic. As in she didn't let me see other people, but she could see a lot of others?

And she gaslit me often, made me emotionally dependent on her, and my mental health tanked.

I felt choked, and scared, and honestly, I was really disappointed: in her, myself, and just the humans around me for being so… inhumane.

Esmeray [Unamused]:
I just… wanted to breathe again. So, I left her, left the school I was at, and transferred here. Blocked everyone I knew, and I hoped that I could start anew.

Esmeray [Neutral 1]:
And I think I did, at least. No one seems to hate me here – just a lot of admiration. …But you never know.

So I wanted to hide everything: never get close to anyone here, never tell anyone my story… but you…

Esmeray [Genuine]:
	You… actually seem to care for me…

	…Thanks, for listening…

Narration:
	Looks like you were right: Esmeray didn't really have genuine friends of his own, so you 
decided it was time to change that.

	You make direct eye contact with Esmeray.

Esmeray [Unamused]:
	W-what? Are you gonna accuse me of being too edgy now, or something?

Player:
	Nah. I just wanted to invite you again to the Radio Club.

I promise we're all nice people, and I guarantee that we're not like those people from your past. 

You can leave if you don't feel like staying with us, no strings attached. I think it would be amazing if you join us. 

Wanna give it a try?

Narration:
	You hold out your hand, ready to receive a handshake in agreement from Esmeray.

	Esmeray stares at your hand, before his own twitches and lifts up to shake it.

	Your face breaks out into a large smile. The mood immediately becomes more lighthearted.

Player:
	Great! Welcome aboard, Esme!

Esmeray [Smile]:
	…W-wait, Esme? I did NOT agree to this, what the f–

Narration [Esmeray Teeth Smile]:
While laughing at him, you give him a set day and time for him to come to the Radio Club, as he continues to protest against your silly, stupid nickname.

[Proceed to next scene]

[Music Room Basic + Printer + Mic + Laptop]
[Kyo_FP_Bruh, Atria2_Nervous, and Skye_Default]

Narration:
Today's finally the day.

You take a deep breath, anxiously looking at the door, trying to spot the familiar shade of dark turquoise hair.

Atria and Skye are just as nervous: Atria is fiddling with their star clips while Skye pushes up her glasses, the light reflecting off of them and covering her eyes.

In the corner stands Kyo, looking at the clock's second hand as it moves in its consistent rhythm.

*tick tick tick tick…*

Kyo sighs.

Kyo:
	When's this guy gonna be here?

Player:
	He'll be here soon, y'all. Don't worry.

Narration:
Atria and Skye turn to look at you with relieved faces, the tense silence of the room finally broken.

Skye:
	W-We're not worried! Y-you are!

Narration:
	You laugh at Skye's poor excuse.

Player:
	Haha, yeah, I am.

Narration:
	Before you can elaborate, you hear footsteps approaching the door.

	All heads in the room turn to the door.

	There it is: that dark turquoise hair.

[Remove all sprites]
[Esmeray Neutral (Centered)]

	In walks Esmeray, his face blank, scanning the room before his eyes land on you.

Immediately, you stand up and go to his side, before making jazz hands in his direction while facing the rest of your group.

[Proceed to two choices: <Introduce Esmeray> or <Wait for Esmeray to introduce themselves>]

[Choice 1: Introduce Esmeray]

[Scene reconverges here]

[Choice 2: Wait for Esmeray to introduce themselves]

Narration:
	You want to let Esmeray introduce himself, and do jazz hands to start it off.

	Really, you're just doing jazz hands in awkward silence…

…

...What are you doing right now? Lol.

	You cough awkwardly at the silence before slowly putting your hands down.

	You clear your throat again, desperate to get out of this situation.
[Scene reconverges here]

Player:
Here he is! Y'all, I want you to meet Esme– I mean Esmeray, our school's lovely playboy and the composer of our music for the Radio Club! Esmeray, meet the club!

[Move Esmeray to right]
[Atria1_Happy and Skye_Smile on left]

Narration:
Atria waves shyly, while Skye pushes up her glasses further and gives a cool nod directed to Esmeray.

[Remove Atria and Skye]
[Kyo_FP_Neutral on right]

Narration:
Kyo scans Esmeray up and down before looking at the chalkboard in the classroom, eyeing the UFO and smiling fondly.

[Remove Kyo]
[Esmeray Genuine]

Narration:
	Esmeray raises his hand in greeting.

Esmeray:
	Yo. Esmeray, he/they.

Narration:
	The room goes quiet again.

	You're really sick of trying to be an extrovert in these awkward situations.

	Before you can say another word, however, Atria suddenly stands up.

[Move Esmeray to right]
[Atria2_Happy and Skye_Smile2 on left]

Atria:
	*Ahem*

	W-WELCOME, ESMERAY, TO THE RADIO CLUB! I-I'M ATRIA, THEY/THEM.

Skye:
I-I'M SKYE, SHE/THEY, AND THESE ARE MY OTHER FRIENDS AND MEMBERS OF THE CLUB. T-TREAT THEM WELL, D-DUDE!

Narration:
	Skye gestures to the air next to her.

	Esmeray looks at the air, then at you, with a confused expression.

	He looks back at the air, and slowly nods in greeting.

	Skye's face brightens up.

Atria:
N-Now that we're all introduced, we will now start the induction ceremony. Player said that you would be a great ally to our cause to save humanity as we know it.

[Remove Atria and Skye]
[Kyo_FP_Cheerful]

Kyo:
Lmao, you said that, Player? You're a weirdo too, hahaha.

Player:
What? I-I didn't say that, I think?? I–

[Remove Kyo]
[Atria2_Happy and Skye_Smile2 on left]

Narration:
You're cut off by Atria, who is too busy immersing in their role right now.

Atria: 
Therefore, we have to ask you…

Skye:
Esmeray, do you solemnly swear to  promise to uphold the values of honor, truth, and transparency between fellow members? To join the club and fight the dark souls of corruption of the students through the power of voice and music? To not rest, until humanity is purified of evil, deceit, and misinformation?

Narration:
	The room becomes silent again after the two of them speak up.

	You sweatdrop, looking at Esmeray cautiously while trying not to burst out laughing.

[Remove Atria and Skye]
[Esmeray Neutral (centered)]

Narration:
	Esmeray's face is blank, eyeing the two in front of him.

	Suddenly, he lets out a low chuckle, which gradually becomes louder until he's almost cackling.

Esmeray [Amused]:
	…Pft.

	…PuhahaA… PftahaHAHA!

Esmeray [Teeth Smile]:
	AHAhaAHahaha!

	…Pft.

Esmeray [Smile 1]:
	…

S-Sure, I'll join the club and fight the dark souls of corruption of the students through the power of the club or whatever. This'll be fun.

[Esmeray Teeth Smile]

Narration:
	On Esmeray's face is a wide, genuine smile as he continues to laugh.

	Atria and Skye are in shock, while Kyo starts to laugh along with Esmeray.

[Move Esmeray to right]
[Skye_Smile2 and Atria2_Smile on left]

Skye:
	H-Hey! It's true, the dark souls exist and need to be taken down!

Narration:
	As she talks, Skye motions a punch into her palm.

Atria:
	Y-Yeah! Don't underestimate our drive to help the poor students of ILUNA Academy!

Narration:
	Esmeray just nods, as if he is in total agreement.

Atria and Skye continue to talk loudly, and eventually the three of them start to converse about their interests and such.

You watch the scene fondly. Finally, the club is complete!
