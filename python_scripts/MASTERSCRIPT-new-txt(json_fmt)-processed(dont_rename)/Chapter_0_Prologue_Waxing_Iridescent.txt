 " Narration  Chapter_0_0000700 It\'s lunch break at school, but the atmosphere is livelier than usual. Oh right, it\'s Club Day today. You still can\'t decide which club you want to join this year.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0000900 You stop walking the hallways to look at the board of various club posters. Oh man, you\'ve never joined one before, so the amount of options overwhelm you a little. You think of just joining multiple clubs at a time, but you quickly brush off that thought. Clubs are supposed to be a good break from the humdrum of academics. Don\'t get ahead of yourself. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0001100 There\'s an art club poster. That\'s a hard no. The most artistic you\'ve ever been was when you colored the sky a solid green and the ground magenta. Only because the other crayons were missing. And that was in a coloring book. Not fun at all. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0001300 There are also a few posters advertising different sports clubs. No thanks. P.E. class already tires you out daily. There\'s no way you have the endurance to do that kind of stuff in your precious free time.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0001500 Oh god, there\'s also the paranormal activity club. No way. Nope. You don\'t take the supernatural as seriously as its club members do. You know this because earlier at brunch today, the club advertised by telling ghost stories that were, in their own words, “real, not clickbait.” " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0001700 One of them even said, “In fact, there\'s a ghost in this school right now, giving bad luck to people who are about to do presentations!” Nonsense. You\'re a junior and you are damn sure that there were no ghosts the entire time you attended school. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0001900 It would be fine if the club was interested in ghosts just for fun, but their fervent attitude says otherwise. You shudder at the thought of even talking to them.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0002100 Ooh, a debate club poster. You don\'t consider yourself a chatterbox, but it\'s always fascinating to listen to other people\'s perspectives and find ways to decimate their arguments. It\'s basically a fun way to talk shit to others. Well, for the most part, save for some annoyingly serious people... " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0002300 Damn, besides the debate club, it looks like you don\'t have many good options here. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0002500 Wait, what\'s with that poster over there?  " ,

 " Radio club poster (wall poster). Allow toggle for zoom in to the RadioClub.png in Art folder.  Chapter_0_0002700 Radio club poster (wall poster). Allow toggle for zoom in to the RadioClub.png in Art folder. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0002900 It advertises... a radio club? Interesting. Teachers love to praise your diction and confidence in your class presentations. This could be worth a try.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0003100 You enter a nearby room with the radio club sign on its door.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0003800 There\'s only one student here. Yet, you can tell that you\'re in the right place. Her appearance is just as colorful as the poster, and the graffiti beside her only emphasizes that. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0004000 The microphone on the other side of the room looks too high for her to reach. That’s a bit weird. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0004200 It looks like the girl’s still on her phone. You decide to get her attention. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0004500 Hi, I wanna join the radio club. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0004800 She puts her phone away and turns around. " ,

 " ??? Kyo_FP_Shocked  Chapter_0_0005100 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0005400 The student\'s voice then drops a few octaves lower than you expect her to have. " ,

 " ??? Kyo_FP_Bruh  Chapter_0_0005700 You fucking scared the shit out of me! My god.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0006000 Well, you now know two things. One, this girl is actually a guy. Two, this dude’s language is as colorful as his hair. What a bombastic impression you’ve left on each other. It only goes uphill from here. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0006300 Sorry, I just walked in. Is this the wrong room? I think I\'m in the wrong ro— " ,

 " Kyo FP_Default  Chapter_0_0006600 No no, wait. I made sure that the door had a sign on it. You\'re here for the radio club, right? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0006900 Yeah, that\'s kinda what I said before you started freaking out.  " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0007200 Okay, okay, my bad. I literally didn\'t hear you walk in. Anyways, hi, I\'m Kyo Kaneko. What\'s your name? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0007500 I\'m Player.  " ,

 " Player. Alright, here's how the club works.  Chapter_0_0007800 Player. Alright, here\'s how the club works. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0008100 Wait, you\'re not gonna be writing anything on the board or something like that? " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0008400 Nah. It\'s not that complicated.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0008700 Is that his way of saying that he\'s not prepared? " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0009000 For now, this club mainly does school announcements, but I plan to make it so that we also do podcasting too.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0009300 You reach into your backpack. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0009500 Kyo looks at you in confusion. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0009800 Oh don\'t mind me, I\'m just gonna eat my lunch. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0010100 Ooh, what are you having? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0010400 Butter croissants. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0010700 Kyo stares at your bread a little longer than you want him to. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0011000 Can I have some? " ,

 " Proceed to two choices <Sure, you can have a bit.> or <No, this is mine. Get your own.>  Chapter_0_0011200 Proceed to two choices: <Sure, you can have a bit.> or <No, this is mine. Get your own.> " ,

 " Choice 1 Sure, you can have a bit.  Chapter_0_0011400 Choice 1: Sure, you can have a bit. " ,

 " Kyo FP_Bruh  Chapter_0_0011700 Actually, never mind. There are probably some RAAAAAAAANCID germs in there. I don\'t want any of that. I refuuuuuuuuuuse. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0012000 The nerve of this guy...!  " ,

 " Scene reconverges here  Chapter_0_0012200 Scene reconverges here " ,

 " Choice 2 No, this is mine. Get your own.  Chapter_0_0012500 Choice 2: No, this is mine. Get your own. " ,

 " Kyo_FP_Bruh  Chapter_0_0012700 Kyo_FP_Bruh " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0013000 Kyo whines and pouts. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0013200 What is up with this guy? Yet, you find his pouting face a little cute. Like a puntable cat.  " ,

 " Scene Reconverges Here  Chapter_0_0013300 Scene Reconverges Here " ,

 " Kyo FP_Default  Chapter_0_0013600 Anyways, since this club requires confident people, I\'d say you\'re a pretty good candidate so far. Most people don’t have the balls to approach me. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0013900 You look up and down at Kyo incredulously. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0014200 Really? You’re not even tall enough to reach the mic over there. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0014500 Hey hey, shut up. Shut the fuck up. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0014800 Kyo looks up at the classroom clock. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0015100 Lunch\'s almost over. So, whaddya say, you wanna join the club or not? " ,

 " Proceed to two choices <Yes> or <No>  Chapter_0_0015300 Proceed to two choices: <Yes> or <No> " ,

 " Choice 1 Yes.  Chapter_0_0015500 Choice 1: Yes. " ,

 " Kyo_FP_Cheerful  Chapter_0_0015700 Kyo_FP_Cheerful " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0016000 Kyo claps his hands. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0016300 Yeah, let\'s go! Finally, there\'s a second member. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0016600 Wait, nobody else is in this club yet?  " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0016900 Oh shit, I forgot to tell you. Yeah, you\'re the only one who joined so far. But here\'s where you come in. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0017200 To officially register the club, I\'m gonna need you to recruit 3 more people by the end of the month. You can do it, you\'re charismatic enough. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0017500 Hold on, I didn\'t agree to do free labor. Why don\'t you do it yourself— " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0017800 The lunch bell rings. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0018100 Too late, gotta go. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0018400 Hey, wait! " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0018700 You catch a glimpse of Kyo grinning as he bolts past you and out the door. He sings as he escapes into the hallways, cracking his voice. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0019000 Running through the halls so fast, something something dash— " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0019300 And just like that, he makes a left and disappears. The nerve of this dude to leave you hanging like that. . .  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0019500 You go in the opposite direction to your class. As you make your way there, you think about his request. It\'s a lot of work, but it\'s not like you have other plans or commitments this year. Eh, fuck it, you ball. " ,

 " Fade to black  Chapter_0_0019700 Fade to black " ,

 " Proceed to Chapter 1  Chapter_0_0019800 Proceed to Chapter 1 " ,

 " Choice 2 No.  Chapter_0_0020100 Choice 2: No. " ,

 " Kyo FP_Sad  Chapter_0_0020400 Oh, why not?  " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0020700 Oh, don\'t take this the wrong way. It\'s just that I wanna consider my other options.  " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0021000 Like what? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0021300 Hm? Isn\'t it normal to do that?  " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0021600 What other clubs were you thinking of joining? Because this club can do better than all of them. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0021900 Where did this sudden pushiness and big ego come from?  " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0022200 I was thinking of joining the debate club— " ,

 " Kyo FP_Bruh  Chapter_0_0022500 Bro, I am right here. I am THE debate master. I\'m not all business all the time you know. I can do other things outside of club meetings.  " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0022800 Okay, but I have to ask. You\'re cool and all, but are you the only club member?  " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_0_0023100 Yes, but I\'m gonna get more soon— " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0023400 Look, I\'ll go check out other clubs later this week. If I don\'t like any of them, I\'ll come back here. Okay? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0023700 The lunch bell rings. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_0_0024000 Don\'t wanna be late to class. See ya. " ,

 " Kyo_BP_Sad  Chapter_0_0024200 Kyo_BP_Sad " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0024500 You feel a little guilty seeing his dejected expression as you leave the classroom. But it\'s too late now; you stick to your decision and go to your next class. " ,

 " Empty black screen.  Chapter_0_0024700 Empty black screen. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_0_0025000 The next day, you try to find Kyo in the radio club room. But the room is empty. You try asking people about Kyo’s whereabouts, but people don’t even know who he is. What the hell. That’s weird. Eh, whatever. Life continues to be lonely as usual. " ,
