 " Narration  Chapter_1-0000700 … " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0000900 The fresh air really is relaxing when there\'s so much going on. Having to recruit members for a radio club of all things, and so suddenly too… as if that isn’t crazy enough, the amount of drama at the school has been…irritating, to say the least. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0001100 Hell, it’s insane. …Those damn rumors that the school is haunted are… unnerving, to say the least. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0001400 …People are so desperate to just get a reaction out of people, huh… at this point I don’t doubt this school’s going to digress into chaos. " ,

 " Kyo Kyo_FP_Smiling  Chapter_1-0001700 Chaos? I call it fun! " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0002000 WHAT TH– " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0002300 Have you found any recruits yet? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0002600 …Warn me next time before sneaking up on me, will you?? " ,

 " Kyo Kyo_FP_Cheerful  Chapter_1-0002900 No thanks. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0003200 Kyo leans forward, his hands on his hips. His expression screams nothing but smug mockery, plainly amused at your annoyance. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0003500 Now, you’ve found someone, right? Surely it can\'t be so hard to evaluate who here is a good candidate. Not when there are very few people who stand out amongst the rest. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0003800 He speaks as if he already has certain people in mind. If so, why is he so insistent on you recruiting members as opposed to him? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0004100 No, Kyo, it has quite literally only been a couple hours. " ,

 " Kyo Kyo_FP_Bruh  Chapter_1-0004400 Mhm… from the way you’re acting now, I’ve most likely put too much faith in you… I guarantee you’re just too introverted to go up and ask someone to join. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0004700 …Actually, I genuinely haven’t seen anyone who looks suitable. A radio club requires someone who is willing to… well, talk. Right? " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0005000 Right… " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0005200 You sure you\'re not just scared to interact with people? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0005500 Shut up. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0005800 Jeez. For someone he just met, Kyo sure has some nerve. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0006100 I hate to break it to you, Mr. know-it-all, but I have yet to see anybody who seems talkative. If anything, I’m the most extroverted person here. " ,

 " Narration Kyo_FP_Cheerful  Chapter_1-0006400 Kyo just shoots you a cocky grin, rolling his eyes playfully.  " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0006700 Mhm, very believable. Just be a bit more observant, will you? It really can’t be that difficult to find someone. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0007000 But- " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0007300 Yeah, yeah. I get it. Your short attention span won\'t allow you to tune into one person for more than 15 seconds. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0007600 You scowl at his remark, but your reaction only further enables him to keep poking at you. You didn’t really mind his banter, but at the very least you wish you could have the ability to snap back. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0007900 What do you want me to do? Just sit and observe as someone goes about their day?? Just stand menacingly in some corner and watch them? " ,

 " Kyo Kyo_SP_Default  Chapter_1-0008200 No need to make it sound so creepy. Listen, you gotta do what you gotta do. Just don’t make it too obvious.  " ,

 " Kyo Kyo_SP_Default  Chapter_1-0008400 Though, from what I’ve seen, I’m starting to even question whether you’re capable of that much. " ,

 " Proceed to two choices <Let it slide> or <Try proving him wrong>  Chapter_1-0008500 Proceed to two choices: <Let it slide> or <Try proving him wrong> " ,

 " Choice 1 Let it slide  Chapter_1-0008700 Choice 1: Let it slide " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0009000 Kyo snickers, tilting his head momentarily as if discreetly pointing somewhere.  " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0009300 I bet you anything if you actually listen you’ll find someone immediately. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0009600 Your eyes follow the direction of his nudge. " ,

 " Scene reconverges here  Chapter_1-0009800 Scene reconverges here " ,

 " Choice 2 Try proving him wrong  Chapter_1-0010100 Choice 2: Try proving him wrong " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0010400 You glance around, searching for someone you can listen in on to make your point. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0010600 Your ears pick up on some commotion, and your attention drifts. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0011300 At that moment, you see a group of girls across the courtyard. They all seem rather silent–bored, even– but one of them in particular stands out to you. " ,

 " ???  Chapter_1-0011600 Anyways! About the person I was talking about earlier, the one that I frequently watch. They did this one stream recently, it was a collaboration with some of my favorite streamers! When I saw the waiting room for it, I got really excited! " ,

 " ???  Chapter_1-0011900 I sent it to you guys a while back, though I’m not sure if you saw it? Neither of you responded… Do you think there\'s a possibility we could watch it together sometime? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0012200 The two other girls look at each other before faking a smile towards her direction. " ,

 " Girl A  Chapter_1-0012500 ...You’re ranting about these streamers every two seconds, you expect us to know which one you are talking about? " ,

 " ??? Atria1_Nervous  Chapter_1-0012800 Oh– …Yeah. Sorry. I guess sometimes I just say stuff without really thinking. " ,

 " ??? Atria2_Happy  Chapter_1-0013100 The one with… let’s see, I\'m trying to think of a way to describe this to someone who doesn’t watch them. They have… blue hair. It’s short, around shoulder length. Does that ring a bell? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0013400 Wait… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0013600 Short… blue hair…? That\'s… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0013800 Kind of silly. " ,

 " ???  Chapter_1-0014100 I understand if you guys don’t remember! I know I can speak a bit quickly at times. " ,

 " ???  Chapter_1-0014300 Oh! Yeah, the one I was talking about yesterday! Surely you remember th– " ,

 " Girl A  Chapter_1-0014600 Hello? Earth to Atria? Atria Aiyashi? " ,

 " Girl A  Chapter_1-0014800 You know, the Atria that thinks before she goes on meaningless tangents? We’re tired of you constantly bothering us about stuff we aren’t interested in. " ,

 " Atria2_Nervous  Chapter_1-0015000 Atria2_Nervous " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0015300 The small yellow haired girl, supposedly named Atria, tenses at the others’ remark. She had been rambling excitedly about her interests just a moment ago and yet… her tone suddenly falters. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0015600 ...A-Ah.. was I too much?.. " ,

 " Girl B  Chapter_1-0015900 Atria, you can’t keep forgetting we raised you to be silent. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0016200 I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to do anything… " ,

 " Girl B  Chapter_1-0016500 It\'s the same answer every single time. No matter how much we remind you, you go back to your annoying little ‘hyperfixations’. " ,

 " Girl B  Chapter_1-0016700 Surely you can try a bit harder? You’ve been like this for years now. Is there really something stopping you from just… realizing we don’t care? " ,

 " Girl B  Chapter_1-0016900 Take your silly little blue guy and talk about him to yourself, yeah? " ,

 " Atria Atria1_Nervous  Chapter_1-0017200 Genuinely, I didn’t mean to do anything… " ,

 " Girl B  Chapter_1-0017500 Do you want us to help you or not? " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0017800 I’m sorry, okay? " ,

 " Girl B  Chapter_1-0018100 We at least had some sort of faith in you. We thought we could change you to stop you from constantly babbling on…but you haven’t even made any ounce of progress. " ,

 " Girl A  Chapter_1-0018400 The only reason we even tolerate you is because we feel bad. " ,

 " Atria1_Sad  Chapter_1-0018600 Atria1_Sad " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0018900 Atria opens her mouth, as if to speak, but no sound escapes " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0019000 her. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0019200 Her voice is caught, suffocated by the others words and the fear of the repercussions of standing up for herself. Her body language speaks volumes, clearly burdened by the weight of the expectations placed upon her. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0019400 In a shaky, pitiful murmur, she chokes out a rebuttal. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0019700 I-I said I’m sorry, okay? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0020000 Atria seems to regret speaking up halfway through her argument, audible desperation in her wavering voice. However, it was simply idiotic to think that the two standing next to her would back down so easily. " ,

 " Girl B  Chapter_1-0020300 You really can’t do anything right, can you? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0020600 The girl at her side clicks her tongue, smiling manipulatively. " ,

 " Girl B  Chapter_1-0020900 We’re nice enough to give you advice, and you can’t even shut up and take it? You’re lucky we even waste our effort on you.  " ,

 " Girl B  Chapter_1-0021100 What happened to the promise you made us? That you’d do what we ask of you? Do you really want a repeat of what happened last time? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0021400 The third individual reaches upwards, placing a hand on Atria’s shoulder ‘comfortingly’.  " ,

 " Atria2_Sad. Make sprite jump in surprise  Chapter_1-0021600 Atria2_Sad. Make sprite jump in surprise " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0021800 This only causes Atria to flinch and instinctively put her hands " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0021900 up in defense. " ,

 " Girl A  Chapter_1-0022200 ...We’ll take that reaction as a no. " ,

 " Girl A  Chapter_1-0022500 Remember, we\'re your only friends. We\'re really just trying to " ,

 " Girl A  Chapter_1-0022600 do you a favor. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0022900 … " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0023200 There is a hesitation that lasts for what seems like an eternity, as Atria’s expression fades. Her emotion is lacking in comparison to mere seconds ago. It seems forced, for sure, yet it\'s clear she’s putting significant effort into holding this mask. " ,

 " Atria Atria2_Timid  Chapter_1-0023500 …Yeah, thank you for reminding me. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0023800 She lowers her gaze, attempting with all her will to keep a strong, emotionless veil. This would have been manageable for the time being, but the two others don’t even respond to her submission. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0024000 They just… stare.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0024200 Stare as she attempts to keep her composure. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0024500 … " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0024800 … " ,

 " Atria2_Sad – only shown momentarily before she disappears  Chapter_1-0025000 Atria2_Sad – only shown momentarily before she disappears " ,

 " Kyo FP_Shocked, centered  Chapter_1-0025400 … " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0025700 Das crazy. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0026000 …That\'s really all you have to say? " ,

 " Kyo_FP_Smiling  Chapter_1-0026200 Kyo_FP_Smiling " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0026500 Kyo looks at you with an obvious smugness, outwardly unphased by… whatever had just happened between those three.  " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0026800 I told you if you actually took the time to tune into a conversation, it wouldn’t be so hard to find someone. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0027100 What, do you want me to go get her and ask her to join a radio club after that? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0027400 His eyes flicker, looking at the school door where Atria had run off to, then back at you. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0027600 Back… and forth… and back… and– " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0027900 So… are you gonna just sit there? Seriously? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0028200 Wh– " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0028500 Are you even gonna do something? Or nah? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0028800 Kyo looks at you, like he wants you to go run after her. It’s… oddly ominous. Like he just wants an excuse to make you speak with Atria. …Does he know her or something? Is that what this was all about?? " ,

 " Proceed to two choices <Ignore the whole incident> or <Go search for Atria>  Chapter_1-0029000 Proceed to two choices: <Ignore the whole incident> or <Go search for Atria> " ,

 " Choice 1 Ignore the whole incident  Chapter_1-0029200 Choice 1: Ignore the whole incident " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0029500 I really don’t think I should interfere… " ,

 " Kyo_FP_Bruh  Chapter_1-0029700 Kyo_FP_Bruh " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0030000 Kyo stares at you with a tinge of concern. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_1-0030300 …Don’t you think she would be a good candidate for the radio club? …Can’t you just… tell? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0030600 He clearly knows more than he\'s letting on… his consistently unsettling statements are starting to stand out more and more… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0030800 Eh, surely it\'s nothing. There\'s no way this guy can do anything, anyways. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0031100 What is she, the ‘chosen one’ or something? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0031400 You joke, rolling your eyes. " ,

 " Scene reconverges here  Chapter_1-0031600 Scene reconverges here " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0032200 Fine, fine. Let’s go find her, alright? " ,

 " Kyo Kyo_FP_Bruh  Chapter_1-0032500 ...Actually, I think you should go on your own. I… will only get " ,

 " Kyo Kyo_FP_Bruh  Chapter_1-0032600 in the way. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0032900 He speaks in an eerie tone, as if he’s admitting to something. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0033000 What on earth is up with him? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0033300 …Okay? So… you just want me to convince her to join? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0033500 Wait, what do you mean by ‘get in the way’??  " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0033700 … " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0033900 Actually, nevermind. I can see it. " ,

 " Kyo sprite is removed  Chapter_1-0034100 Kyo sprite is removed " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0034400 You look at the school building momentarily, sighing. It’s an irritating reality, but the longer you wait, the harder it will be to find her. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0034700 I guess I’ll see you later then- " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0035000 You look back to where Kyo had stood just a moment ago, your eyes only meeting blank space. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0035300 Huh? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0035600 …He never fails to do something strange, does he? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0035800 You figure you should just get moving. " ,

 " Transition to School Classroom Day  Chapter_1-0036100 Transition to School Classroom Day " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0036900 Atria? Hello? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0037200 …  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0037400 Silence. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0037700 Atria? Don’t worry… I’m not gonna yell. " ,

 " Atria1_Sad  Chapter_1-0037900 Atria1_Sad " ,

 " Centered  Chapter_1-0038000 Centered " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0038300 You glance around, scanning the room, your eyes spotting a fragile figure hunched in the corner. The eye contact causes her body to tense, as if she were expecting judgment, or ridicule. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0038600 …W-why do you… know my name…? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0038900 Atria speaks between quiet sobs, her voice strained with emotion. She’s vulnerable, her guard shattered from the weight of her own struggles. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0039200 I… overheard your conversation earlier. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0039500 You take a few steps towards her, careful not to invade her space. Despite your carefulness, she pushes herself against the walls, making herself appear as small and insignificant as possible. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0039800 D-did they send you here… to deal with me…? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0040100 Her voice drips with anticipation. Anticipation to be met with some sort of pain, whether it be emotional or physical. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0040400 No– it’s nothing of the sort. My name is Player… It… must be really exhausting having to listen to their torment. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0040600 Do they constantly tell you things like that? " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0040900 I-… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0041200 Atria hesitates, unsure whether she should even respond to such a question. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0041500 They… they just want what’s best for me. They’ve been my friends for a long time.	 " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0041800 … " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0042000 If you were to disregard the scene that had taken place earlier, her self-assured words would seem genuine.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0042200 She\'s noticeably frustrated, like she\'s trying to convince you to believe in her words. Has she really been tricked into thinking she\'s at fault? To the point she would stand up for those so-called ‘friends’? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0042500 How long, exactly, have they been your friends? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0042800 Your tone is soft, encouraging her to open up. Even so, her eyes dart around, desperately seeking for anywhere to look except your own gaze. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0043100 …As long as I remember. Really, I’m serious… they’re just " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0043200 trying to deal with me. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0043500 Don’t you think they are being a bit… ah, harsh? " ,

 " Atria2_Sad  Chapter_1-0043700 Atria2_Sad " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0044000 You observe Atria closely, noticing the conflict within her as she struggles with her loyalty to her ‘friends’ and their effect on her emotional stability. She seems torn, caught between the conflicting beliefs instilled by her ‘friends’ and the flickers of doubt emerging within her. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0044200 She speaks, her voice laced with a forced conviction. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0044500 It\'s… fine. I’m used to it. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0044800 …Used to it? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0045000 You struggle for a good moment, before a realization hits you; her perception of reality has been shaped by years of… whatever they had done to her. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0045200 Comforting and giving advice wasn’t exactly your strong suit... " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0045500 Atria… that\'s not normal. " ,

 " Atria Atria2_Timid  Chapter_1-0045800 Huh? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0046100 She takes a few seconds to herself, a mix of confusion and curiosity seeping through her expression. You take the silence as an opportunity to explain and clear up any possible questions. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0046400 What I mean is, friends are meant to encourage your hobbies, and allow you to open up about yourself. What I saw back there wasn’t healthy… nor acceptable. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0046700 You speak with a confident tone, pushing aside your own uncertainties on how to navigate such a sensitive conversation. The more you speak, however, the more confusion crosses Atrias face. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0047000 But… that\'s how it’s always been. It\'s been like that for as " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0047100 long as I remember. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0047400 The confusion of the whole situation only proved the depth of her conditioning. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0047600 The dynamics you had witnessed between her and her so-called ‘friends’ seem to be ingrained in her entire understanding of relationships. It blurs the line of what she depicts as acceptable or not.  " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0047900 Do you mind explaining to me what your friends have been like towards you? Perhaps I can get a better insight on what exactly is going on. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0048100 I… understand if you don’t want to share. Though it really could help me evaluate who’s in the wrong. " ,

 " Atria Atria1_Timid  Chapter_1-0048400 …I would, but… they don’t really like me talking to other " ,

 " Atria Atria1_Timid  Chapter_1-0048500 people… " ,

 " Atria Atria1_Timid  Chapter_1-0048700 …But… the way you are talking to me completely contradicts the things that they have said would happen if I did… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0049000 Atria mumbles, taking in a deep breath as she contemplates whether or not she should open up. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0049300 …Alright, just– please don’t tell them I said anything. Nobody… has ever, er… offered this to me, so… I’m not really sure how they would react if they found out. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0049600 You nod, reassuring her. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0049900 I wouldn’t dream of it. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0050200 Atria visibly relaxes, her tense posture softening slightly as she starts to consider sharing her experiences. It\'s a step into the unknown for her.  " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0050500 Okay, just… give me a moment.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0050800 She takes a deep breath, steadying herself as she gathers the courage to break the chains of silence that have bound her for so long. " ,

 " Atria1_Nervous  Chapter_1-0051000 Atria1_Nervous " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0051200 A weak smile forms as she reminisces. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0051500 I met them in 2nd grade, and they were the first people in my life that would actually call me a friend. …They never really liked me hanging out with others. So, since then, I’ve just kind of stuck with them. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0051700 They helped me, and they still help me to this day. The least I can do for them is follow a couple orders here and there. …I don’t exactly know what would happen if I didn’t do as they asked, anyways. There\'s no use putting up too much of a fight. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0052000 A small, breathless laugh leaves her, but it seems rather simulated. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0052300 They remind me when I speak too much, and push me to improve myself. They put up with me, even now, after years of not being able to keep to myself. " ,

 " Atria1_Timid  Chapter_1-0052500 Atria1_Timid " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0052800 Atria’s expression fades as she takes a moment to think about what she had just said. Quietly, she repeats her words to herself. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0053100 …Years. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0053400 I’m… lucky they even stick around. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0053700 Her words are solemn, yet she accepts this idea as the truth with no troubles. You shake your head. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0054000 I… I can’t know exactly what your life has been like, but from what I saw back there, they… really don’t seem like they are doing this for your sake.  " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0054200 I can understand it\'s difficult to accept this, especially since you haven’t been exposed to kinder relationships. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0054400 However, isolating you from others and demanding obedience is not a healthy dynamic. You have individuality, and it shouldn’t be suppressed. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0054700 You emphasize the qualities of healthy relationships, hoping your words impact her twisted definition of a friend. " ,

 " Atria2_Timid  Chapter_1-0054900 Atria2_Timid " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0055100 She looks up in thought, finding it difficult to grasp the foreign concept that her ‘friends’ actions may not align with true friendship. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_1-0055400 But… they\'ve always said it\'s for my own good. That their guidance and control are necessary to make me better. Isn’t… that how friends are supposed to be? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_1-0055700 You look at her questioningly, wondering how exactly you could explain this to her when her thought process had been so warped and muddled. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_1-0056000 …Here, imagine this; a friendship where you are allowed to express yourself freely, and your thoughts and feelings are valued.  " ,
