 " Narration  Chapter_2-0001000 You and Kyo sleepily make your way down through the quiet school corridor to the radio club room. Neither of you were fit to stand, let alone walk, but– " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0001300 Why are we here this early again? School hasn\'t even started yet… " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_2-0001600 I\'m not happy about this either, but someone needs to prep the club equipment. S\'not like we got a tonna members to figure this shit out yet. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0001900 We\'d have more members if you actually helped with recruitment y\'know. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_2-0002200 Hey, that\'s what you\'re for. I have very important club president things to deal with. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0002500 You grumble, but the both of you continue to make your way down the hall. Even if you lumbered the whole way like a zombie who had already lost its head, only the empty corridors and a snickering Kyo would witness such a scene. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0005500 You approach the door, giving it a tentative knock that abruptly silences the voice. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0007100 A slight flush climbs her face at her stumble, but she stubbornly continues to try and fake disinterest. She’s failing miserably, but you could say she was attempting it with an almost admirable persistence. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0007400 Uhhh… I heard you talking, and… was wondering what you were doing in the closet…? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0007700 The flush on the girl’s face only grew, her flusteredness leaking into her words, making her ramble slightly. " ,

 " Girl in the Closet  Chapter_2-0008000 Well if you must know, I was conducting a very important meeting with my friends. The closet just happens to be a very convenient place for us to do so without any disturbance or without inadvertently disturbing anyone else. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0008300 She pushes the closet door open further, stepping out into the hallway. She dusts her skirt off primly, not at all subtly looking away in embarrassment. The closet, left open as it was, shows no one else inside.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0008500 You look back at Kyo in confusion, receiving an equally confused look from the blue haired boy.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0008700 You turn back to the girl who in turn looks at you strangely, darting her eyes towards Kyo questioningly. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0008900 You shrug off the girl’s still strange choice of meeting location and lack of other people to have a meeting with. Not that you could really judge people on their social choices. After all, most would probably call you crazy for befriending Kyo… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0009200 I heard you narrating? I think? You speak really well. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0009500 A surprised expression flickers through her face before her attempt at a cool expression slides back into place. Her expressiveness, still not hiding her feelings, allows a small bit of smug pride to shine through. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0010700 I\'m Player. Nice to meet you.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0012800 Surprised at Kyo’s sudden interest, you look at him questioningly. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0013100 Think it\'s a good idea? We don\'t really know her… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0015700 We don\'t have a lot of members but we\'re pretty sure we can get more people to sign up. I think you\'d be a perfect fit for a broadcaster. You think you\'d be up for it? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0016000 A lost look of wonder briefly crosses her eyes before quickly dimming. She looks to the side, her eyes contemplative. Skye hums consideringly before answering mildly. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0016300 Well, I\'ll have to talk to my friends first, not sure I\'ll have the time considering all the things that I\'ve been needing to do lately. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0016600 Skye makes a big gesture of turning to the side, suddenly starting to talk loudly and gesturing broadly as if conversing with a group of people. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0017400 You and Kyo look at her bewilderedly as silence meets Skye\'s question, but Skye only continues talking to the air, nodding and humming, responding as if someone was talking back to her. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0017700 –you\'re right, I\'m not in any other clubs right now but what about our campaigns? We usually conduct them right after school, we– " ,

 " Player and Kyo  Chapter_2-0018000 … " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0018300 Skye continues talking to nothing. You’re starting to get concerned that staying in the chemical and dust filled janitor’s closet is having a more detrimental effect on her than one would expect. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0018600 Uhhh… Skye? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0018900 Skye only hums at you, looking like she was only half listening to you as she continues to nod at the thin air near her. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0019200 Who’re you talkin’ to? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0019500 Skye answers your question distractedly, still seeming completely engrossed at whatever it is she’s listening to. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0019800 I\'m talking to my friends, of course. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0020100 Skye gestures at the empty air beside her, only half listening to your question. " ,

 " Player and Kyo Kyo_FP_Bruh  Chapter_2-0020400 … " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0021300 You hiss at Kyo, throwing a smack to the short boy’s shoulder that he dodges with an indignant yelp. You frantically turn back to Skye, hoping she didn’t hear Kyo’s expected but poorly timed smacktalk. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0021500 Skye, unfortunately, did seem to notice your antics and blinks " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0021600 at you once more, bewildered. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0022700 It\'s nice to know someone like me! A person who knows the " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0022800 pros to our more unusual friends… " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_2-0023400 The fuck, did she just call me unusual? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0023700 Skye\'s expression only brightens further, her thick glasses not nearly covering her delight. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0024000 You\'re pretty nice. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0024300 She looks consideringly to the side again, her smile turning contemplative. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0024600 I actually might consider visiting your club after all. After classes, of course. I\'m pretty sure I can help you with things even without joining the club! " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0024900 She suddenly rushes to grab your hand, making you stumble back in surprise. She quickly gives the limb a firm, decisive shake, before backing away just as quickly. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0025200 I\'m looking at a very busy day ahead, so I\'ll be taking my leave now. It was nice to meet you, Player! " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0026200 Well… she was interesting. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_2-0026500 I mean, she’s a little weird, but so was the other one, and you… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0026800 Kyo’s words prompts an eye roll from you, breaking you from the reverie that Skye’s abrupt getaway left you. The two of you finally start to make your way to the clubroom again, the strange encounter still fresh on your minds. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0027100 I think she’ll be a good addition to the team, and she’s nice, she and Atria will probably get along great. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_2-0027400 Sure, if you can get her to join. Still haven’t gotten to that part, remember? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0027700 You wince at Kyo’s reminder, but as you remember her look of wonder when you first asked her the question, you don’t think it’ll be very difficult to convince her. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0027900 She was happy to be invited, she may have some reservations but you have a feeling that everything’ll  turn out just fine. You shrug off Kyo’s pessimism, shooting the shorter boy an eyeroll as the two of you enter the clubroom to deal with your duties for the day. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0029300 Encouraged by its angry rumblings, you make your way to the school store. Hopefully you weren’t too late to grab something. No one should have to handle the angry yowling that you know your stomach would continue to make if the beast wasn’t fed. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0031000 Why would I graffiti the classroom? You’re accusing me out of nowhere. Again. " ,

 " Student B  Chapter_2-0031600 Who else would’ve done it? You’ve always been attention seeking. Just the other day you were talking to thin air again! God, you’re annoying on a good day but now you’re actually destroying public property? Can you get any worse? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0031900 Skye scoffs at their accusations, squinting at her classmates incredulously. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0032200 No one knows who did it. The classroom doors are locked every night and they’re only opened in the mornings, minutes before class starts. I wasn’t even the first person to arrive today. Your accusations have no merit and exactly zero people have come to tell me their thoughts of otherwise besides you three. This is the third time you’ve accused me of shit I didn’t do and it’s honestly getting out of hand. You– " ,

 " Student C  Chapter_2-0032500 Oh my god, can you just stop talking? No one wants to hear you yap all day! It\'s enough that you run your mouth in class all the time! " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0032800 Rolling her eyes, Skye seems done with the whole interaction. She waves the person off, already moving to leave. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0033100 I\'m sorry that you\'re incapable of understanding anything higher than the most basic levels of communication, let me clear it up for you. I don\'t have time for your bs, get the fuck out of my way. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0033400 Skye attempts to sidestep her way out of the people surrounding her, but the increasingly angered trio move to block her way. " ,

 " Student D  Chapter_2-0033700 You sure do know how to talk, you think people like you interrupting the class every time to spout whatever bullshit opinion you have? Everyone\'s tired of you. " ,

 " Student B  Chapter_2-0034000 Yeah, I mean come on, even Sensei had to take you to the side the other day. You might be a teacher’s pet but even they know you’re a lunatic. " ,

 " Skye_Sad  Chapter_2-0034200 Skye_Sad " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0034500 Skye’s bored expression finally cracks, vulnerability seeping through. She looks away, shifting uncomfortably before glaring back at the person speaking. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0034800 Sensei appreciates my contributions to the class, and they said so themself. They just wish that I give a chance to the rest of the class to express their opinions as well and I concurred. You three should stop talking about things that you don\'t understand. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0035100 The atmosphere was slowly getting more tense. It might get bad for Skye if you don\'t intervene. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0038600 I don\'t know who you three are, but ganging up on someone is seriously low. From the little I\'ve heard, you don\'t even have a leg to stand on. Accusing somebody for something you have no proof of is ridiculous and mocking someone for participating in class is pathetic. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0040000 Skye stays quiet during the entire interaction. As you arrive at a quieter corner, you face her again, concerned. You don\'t know her very well, but from the little interaction you\'ve had with her, her silence seems uncharacteristic. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0040300 Skye, are you okay? I\'m sorry for eavesdropping but you looked like you needed help. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0040600 Skye looks away, her shoulders hunched, defences built all the way up. She looks clearly uncomfortable and not willing to talk about what had just happened. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0040900 I\'m fine… Thanks for getting me out of there, those three were getting way too cocky. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0041200 Would you like to report them to a teacher? I heard you mention that this wasn\'t the first time this has happened… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0041500 Skye shakes her head, dismissing the notion immediately. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0041800 No no, it\'s fine, they\'re not– they don\'t even bother me usually. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0042100 A heavy silence settles between the two of you. You\'re not really sure what to say; you don\'t think you really know Skye well enough to comfort her. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0042300 Skye suddenly starts talking again, finally looking at you directly. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0042600 People like the discussions that I bring up in class. They say that my insight helps them learn more about the subject we\'re learning about while simultaneously allowing them to not have to be called on unexpectedly when they\'re not willing to. I– " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0042900 Skye cuts herself off before she finishes her sudden explanation, frustration leaking into her voice. A shuddering breath leaves her before she closes her mouth, pursing her lips. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0051300 You come up to the blue haired boy, swinging an arm up to his shoulders – a move he deftly avoids. He quickly stands up from his own seat. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_2-0051600 I\'m gonna slip out for a bit – got a couple of things I need to deal with for class tomorrow. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0051900 Your eyes widen, surprised at his abrupt need to leave and concerned that you had gone too far with your teasing. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0052200 Whoa, you don’t have to leave. We don’t have to talk about ghosts if you don’t want to. " ,

 " Kyo_FP_Default  Chapter_2-0052400 Kyo_FP_Default " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0052700 Kyo rolls his eyes, waving off your silent apology while moving to leave the room. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_2-0053000 What? No, I just remembered I got shit to do, hold down the fort for me will you? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0053300 Aren\'t you gonna help me convince Skye to join the club? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0053600 Kyo raises an eyebrow at you, stopping before opening the clubroom door, face set in a deadpan. " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_2-0053900 You think my caustic ass\'ll help convince her to join? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0054200 You wince slightly, remembering Kyo impulsively ribbing Skye just this morning. She didn’t seem to take offence, but maybe exposing her too much to Kyo\'s sharp tongue too early would be ill-advised. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0054500 Don’t you wanna stick around to at least greet her? " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_2-0054800 When’s she coming? Does she even know where the clubroom is? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0055100 Silence envelops the room as his question settles, before you groan in frustration, bringing your hand up to cover your face. Kyo\'s laughter rings throughout the room, the annoying gremlin finding pleasure in your misery. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0055400 I forgot to tell her that we’re using the music room this morning… " ,

 " Kyo  Chapter_2-0055700 You better go find her then, I’m dealing with my shit first. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0056000 Kyo shrugs, casually slipping out of the room and leaving you alone with your thoughts. " ,

 " Kyo Sprite Disappears  Chapter_2-0056200 Kyo Sprite Disappears " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0056500 … " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0056800 You sigh in exasperation, finally standing up to go and find Skye, wherever it is she could be.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0057000 You make your way to the door, opening it before noticing something in the corner of your eye. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0057200 You snap your head in surprise, chasing the glimpse of bright neon shapes before it disappears behind the blink of your eyelids. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0057400 You stare at where you thought you saw… whatever it was you thought you saw, furrowing your brows at the wall. You could’ve sworn– " ,

 " ???  Chapter_2-0057700 Player! " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0058000 A voice calls out to you from the hallway right outside the door you just opened, snapping you out of your thoughts. " ,

 " Skye_Default  Chapter_2-0058200 Skye_Default " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0058500 Skye! You’re here? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0058800 You blurt out her name in surprise, instinctively opening the clubroom door further and stepping back to allow the dark haired girl to step inside. She looks around the room, raising her brow curiously. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0059100 Of course, I did promise I would come. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0059400 How’d you find the clubroom? I forgot to tell you where it was this morning… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0059700 Skye waves off your question, turning to look at you curiously. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0060000 The clubrooms are almost always on the first floor. I was just walking around to look when I saw you at the door… Were you looking at something? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0060300 Huh? " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0060600 You looked a little out of it. I saw you for quite a little bit before calling you. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0060900 You look back at the wall, pursing your lips thoughtfully before shaking your head. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0061200 Was nothing, probably just tired. I’m glad you came by! I wasn’t sure if you would, uhh, after… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0061500 You trail off a little, cursing yourself for bringing up the grim situation from the afternoon. You thought you were getting better at not putting your foot in your mouth, yet here you are, swallowing your whole fucking shoe. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0061700 A short silence comes after the words awkwardly dry up in your mouth, making you sweat bullets. Skye picks up on the conversation, moving deeper inside the room and casually settling herself on one of the chairs. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0062000 The graffiti’s gone. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0062300 What? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0062600 You blink bewilderedly. Skye shrugs, casually leaning her head on her arm settled on the table. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0062900 The class left for gym class a little bit after lunch and by the time we came back, poof, it just…disappeared.  " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0063100 The teachers figured it was a temporary prank someone was pulling. They’re still looking for the culprit, but nothing points to it being anyone in class, considering that we were all accounted for at gym… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0063400 And… those guys that were bothering you? " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0063700 Well they didn’t apologise, but they did look pretty pissed that it was pretty clearly not me. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0064000 Skye shrugs faux casually. It\'s difficult to figure out what she\'s thinking. She seems a little bit more closed off than she was this morning. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0064300 Anyway, you don’t have to worry about those idiots, they’re way more of a nuisance then they are actually troubling. My class is filled with a lot of kind and friendly people, so their voices get drowned out most of the time. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0064600 Skye smiles at you reassuringly, looking up from her previously contemplative pose. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0064900 Now, why don’t we discuss your club? It’s what you invited me here for right? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0065200 Yeah… about joining… " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0065500 Still not too sure that’d be necessary. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0065700 If all you need is another voice to help in broadcasting, or even if you need some journalist help to find some news, I’ll be happy to help out on a more occasional, freelance basis. As long as I’m given some credit for the work, of course. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0066000 You scratch your head in confusion. If Skye was willing to help the club, why not just join and get the benefit of having an after school sanctioned activity? You open your mouth to ask when the sound of the clubroom door opening catches both of your attention. " ,

 " Atria1_Happy appears  Chapter_2-0066200 Atria1_Happy appears " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0066500 Good evening! " ,

 " Atria1_Timid  Chapter_2-0066700 Atria1_Timid " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0067000 Atria’s eyes widen as she notices Skye’s presence in the room, her surprised expression quickly turning to a bashful smile. Atria shuffles quietly into the room, clearly apprehensive but still trying her best to be welcoming. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0067300 Oh! H-hello, do we have a new recruit? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0067600 Umm, not necessarily… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0067900 Atria looks at you questioningly, moving closer to the table and placing her things on it. She fidgets awkwardly with her things before looking up at Skye, smiling uncertainly towards the taller girl. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0068200 I’m Atria. Umm, i-it’s nice to meet you. I’m a… a new member " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0068300 of the club too. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0068600 S-Skye. I– well, I haven’t really– I’m not too sure about joining " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0068700 really… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0069000 Atria’s stumbling responses were sort of expected, but Skye’s stuttering prompts a raised eyebrow from you, confused at her sudden inarticulateness. Noticing your expression, she huffs indignantly, hissing her next words quietly at you. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0069300 Seeing new faces makes me anxious sometimes! You and your friend definitely caught me off guard this morning… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0069600 Oh yeah, you met Kyo this morning. Sorry he couldn’t be here, he stepped out just now. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0069900 Oh. That’s fine, I didn’t bring any of my friends here either. Communication isn’t easy when other parties can’t easily talk to or even see one another. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0070200 You laugh awkwardly remembering Skye’s…friends. It might be a little awkward, navigating Skye’s…eccentricities, but you feel like it would work out… you might have to invest in a sturdier poker face soon though. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0070400 Atria tilts her head in confusion, unaware of all that happened that day. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0070600 Skye flushes brightly, before turning back to the now confused but still shyly smiling Atria. She coughs awkwardly, bringing the discussion back to focus. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0070900 Anyway, like I said, I’m not sure if joining the club would be beneficial for everyone involved. I’d be happy to help y\'all out in general though, you seem like really nice people, mhm. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0071200 O-Oh, that’s too bad. I’m sure you’d be a great new member. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0071500 I agree, that’s kinda why I invited you in the first place. I’m happy that you’re willing to help us generally, but honestly, I’d like you to stick around. I think we’d all get along great. " ,

 " Skye_Sad   Chapter_2-0071700 Skye_Sad  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0072000 Skye seems to flinch at your words, her previous light-hearted expression disappearing in an instant. She looks away from you and Atria, clearly uncomfortable.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0072200 Your eyebrows furrow with worry, you share a glance with Atria, who is now frowning as well. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0072500 Can I ask why you… don’t want to join us? You did mention you hadn’t signed up for any other club yet, and you don’t seem to be against the idea in general. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0072800 I-I\'m a very busy woman. I can\'t just start up a new club out of nowhere! After all, who would conduct my campaigns, and… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0073100 Skye doesn\'t sound convincing, even to herself. She slumps in her chair, sighing tiredly, running her hand through her hair nervously. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0073400 I-It’d just be easier for all of us. You wouldn’t have to deal with me too regularly, and we get to go our own ways. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0073700 A short silence comes after her words. You’re shocked that the cheerful girl from this morning had given you such a self-depreciating answer. Atria, having no basis for the girl\'s personality, shyly answers, noticing the tense mood. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0074000 I understand, I never really got on with people very easily " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0074100 either. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0074400 Atria smiles awkwardly, trying to reassure the clearly struggling Skye. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0074600 You appreciate her support in this situation. It helps ground you a little, having someone else\'s perspective on this. Skye shakes her head, dismissing the notion. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0074900 No no, you’re both really nice, I tend to not work well with others. People tend to be really uncomfortable around me, and even if you didn’t mind tolerating me, I’ll just bring the mood down. Clubwork and community stuff like this never really suited me. " ,

 " Atria1_Sad Sprite   Chapter_2-0075100 Atria1_Sad Sprite  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0075400 Your face scrunches at hearing the familiar narrative from this afternoon, discomfort growing at hearing Skye parroting her aggressors. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0075700 Is this about what those people said on break? If it is, I think we should be able to find out on our own whether or not we get along. I know we just met this morning, but I think you\'re pretty great. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0076000 You don\'t get it, everyone gets tired of me eventually. This isn\'t about what those idiots think, it\'s just a fact. I like to keep whatever amicable acquaintances I have and I do that by keeping some distance. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0076300 Her voice is wrought with agitation and yours, unfortunately, rises in return. Your discomfort turns to upset at the thought of your possible friend thinking so poorly of herself, and by extension, of everyone else around her. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0076600 I think you\'re being a little unfair here. I\'d be more comfortable with your decision if you just weren\'t sure of the club itself, or if you\'re not comfortable with interacting too closely with what would be veritable strangers. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0076800 But, what\'s happening is that you\'re refusing to give us any credit! You\'re so sure we\'re like those assholes that you won\'t give us a chance to even form our own opinions! " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0077100 That\'s not what I\'m saying at all! I\'m just telling you it\'s not gonna work out! " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0077300 Maybe it is about those guys, but didn\'t you hear them? I talk weird, I talk too much, I\'m annoying, people can\'t see Pio-chan and the others and they hate it when I talk to \'em. This stuff isn\'t just a them thing!  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0077600 Skye’s arguments, having reached a fever pitch, suddenly tapers off. She looks to your side where Atria is before blowing out a huge sigh, agitation slowly bleeding out of her.  " ,

 " Atria2_Timid  Chapter_2-0077800 Atria2_Timid " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0078000 You turn to look at Atria, who looks almost frozen in panic. The blonde was not at all prepared to see her possible new friends fighting, especially so close after her own falling out with her previous awful friends not that long ago. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0078200 Skye looks away, still perturbed by your argument but no longer so fired up, leaving her sounding just… painfully tired. " ,

 " Skye_Default  Chapter_2-0078400 Skye_Default " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0078700 Things are just way simpler if I\'m not around most other people. I\'m easier to digest in small doses, so you\'ll get tired of me too, sooner or later. I\'m better off spending time with my friends anyway, and I can\'t do that with other people around. They look at me like I\'m crazy. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0079000 Her joke dies an awkward death. You’re not ready to meet her eyes and you aren’t really sure what to say. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0079200 You want to apologise for getting so worked up and for butting in where your opinions may not be wanted, but you don’t like that she thinks so badly of herself. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0079500 I think we’re all a bit tense right now, maybe this wasn’t such a good idea. I-I’m just gonna go. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0079800 You whip your head back to her, eyes widening.  You open your mouth to call out and clear things up, but a voice stops you from doing so. " ,

 " Atria2_Sad  Chapter_2-0080000 Atria2_Sad " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0080300 W-wait! " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0080600 Atria quickly gets up from her chair, grabbing Skye’s hand to prevent her from leaving. The timid girl holds the limb, trembling, lips pursed tightly as tears prick her eyes. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0080900 Player’s just worried about you. I-I am too. It’s not right that people’ve made you think that you don’t get to have friends, j-just because you’re a little different. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0081200 Atria smiles uncertainly down at their clasped palms, tears still pricking her vision.  " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0081500 I know the feeling… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0081800 Skye’s eyes widened in surprise at the girl’s sudden willfulness. Yours were too at this point. You knew she had some spunk to her from the way she stood up to her former friends, but you weren’t expecting this from her. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0082100 You know what I think? " ,

 " Atria2_Nervous Sprite  Chapter_2-0082300 Atria2_Nervous Sprite " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0082600 Atria speaks up once more, looking up at Skye’s eyes. Her smile quirks, awkwardly but genuinely, trying to reassure the taller girl. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0082900 You’ve probably gone through a lot of things that\'ve caused you pain. I’ve had to work on my own things recently and I get that it is so… so scary to trust other people after everything. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0083200 The blonde circles the table to move closer to the bespectacled girl, before pulling at their clasped hands, bringing the two closer together. Her eyes shine brightly with unshed tears. " ,

 " Atria  Chapter_2-0083500 But, maybe you’d like some help with it? I think we both could use some practice with this friend thing. Why don’t we try this out together? " ,

 " Skye_Smile1  Chapter_2-0083700 Skye_Smile1 " ,

 " Atria1_Happy  Chapter_2-0083800 Atria1_Happy " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0084100 Skye’s eyes are still wide with disbelief, unprepared for the whirlwind of a girl that had just swept her off her feet. A small smile cracks onto her face, still uncertain but now filled with a familiar lost wonder. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0084400 O-okay. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0084700 At this point, you aren’t sure if you should stay in the room. It feels like you’re interrupting something even as the two finally separate, still looking at one another. You finally clear your throat, breaking the two’s reverie, returning their gaze towards you. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0085000 Skye, I’m sorry for how I acted. Atria was right, I was worried, but I should’ve been more sensitive. I… shouldn’t have made it about myself. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0085300 Skye smiles at you for the apology, moving towards you and extending an arm for you to grab. You gratefully take it, grasping onto her palm to shake. Her mouth quirks up in a rueful smirk. " ,

 " Skye  Chapter_2-0085600 I was getting too in my head, I think. I’m happy that you cared enough to try and snap me out of it. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0085900 You smile at each other, relieved that your fight hadn’t caused irreparable damage to your new friendship. You think about the reason you fought in the first place. " ,

 " Proceed to two choices <Don't invite her to the radio club> or <Invite her to the radio club>  Chapter_2-0086100 Proceed to two choices: <Don\'t invite her to the radio club> or <Invite her to the radio club> " ,

 " Choice 1 Don't invite her to the radio club  Chapter_2-0086300 Choice 1: Don\'t invite her to the radio club " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0086600 You aren\'t sure how appropriate it would be to bring up the subject again after such a charged exchange, especially considering that the tension was one started by you. You stay quiet, releasing your hold on her hand.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0086800 To your surprise, a voice pipes up from beside Skye, finally approaching closer after your apologies were finished. " ,

 " Atria Atria2_Happy  Chapter_2-0087100 Skye? Would you maybe consider joining us? Maybe even if it’s later on? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0087400 You’re surprised once again by the girl’s boldness. Looks like she was the braver one out of the two of you. You smile at Skye, emboldened by your friend to ask again. " ,

 " Scene reconverges here  Chapter_2-0087600 Scene reconverges here " ,

 " Choice 2 Invite her to the radio club  Chapter_2-0087800 Choice 2: Invite her to the radio club " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0087900 	Scene reconverges here " ,

 " Player  Chapter_2-0088200 Would you consider it? Joining us at the club? We’d love to have you. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0088500 You aren’t sure if the invite would be taken well, but Skye smiles softly at the two of you. She nods her head, one of her hands coming up to rest on her waist as the next words come out of her mouth. " ,

 " Skye Skye_Smile2  Chapter_2-0088800 Well, you two do look like you could use some help. Where do you think we should start? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0089100 Atria smiles softly as she takes Skye’s hand in hers once more, dragging her to sit on the table as they start discussing ideas for the radio club, what they would prepare for the first broadcast, what news was popular in the school. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0089300 Whatever it is, it seems like they\'re having fun. You can hear Skye snorting with laughter, Atria’s quieter giggles interspersed a little more rarely in the conversation.  " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0089500 You smile at them as you move to settle on the table. " ,

 " Skye CG  Chapter_2-0089700 Skye CG " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0089900 Kyo slips into the room in the middle of all the excitement, quietly sneaking into the corner of the room, settling for looking at what was going on. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0090100 You move to greet him – and maybe grill him for missing yet another certified moment with your new club members – when Kyo motions for you to stop. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0090300 He moves his hands in a shushing motion, gesturing for you to be quiet. The two girls continue their excited discussion, completely unaware of Kyo’s entrance. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0090500 You nod your head at the blue haired boy, returning to look once more at your new friends fondly. You definitely don\'t want to interrupt their bonding either. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_2-0090700 You\'ll have time for more proper introductions later. " ,
