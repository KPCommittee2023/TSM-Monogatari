 " Player  <br><br> Is this about what those people said on break? If it is, I think we should be able to find out on our own whether or not we get along. I know we just met this morning, but I think you\'re pretty great. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0075700 " ,
 " Skye  <br><br> You don\'t get it, everyone gets tired of me eventually. This isn\'t about what those idiots think, it\'s just a fact. I like to keep whatever amicable acquaintances I have and I do that by keeping some distance. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0076000 " ,
 " Narration  <br><br> Her voice is wrought with agitation and yours, unfortunately, rises in return. Your discomfort turns to upset at the thought of your possible friend thinking so poorly of herself, and by extension, of everyone else around her. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0076300 " ,
 " Player  <br><br> I think you\'re being a little unfair here. I\'d be more comfortable with your decision if you just weren\'t sure of the club itself, or if you\'re not comfortable with interacting too closely with what would be veritable strangers. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0076600 " ,
 " Player  <br><br> But, what\'s happening is that you\'re refusing to give us any credit! You\'re so sure we\'re like those assholes that you won\'t give us a chance to even form our own opinions! <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0076800 " ,

 " Skye  <br><br> Maybe it is about those guys, but didn\'t you hear them? I talk weird, I talk too much, I\'m annoying, people can\'t see Pio-chan and the others and they hate it when I talk to \'em. This stuff isn\'t just a them thing!  <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0077300 " ,
 " Narration  <br><br> Skye’s arguments, having reached a fever pitch, suddenly tapers off. She looks to your side where Atria is before blowing out a huge sigh, agitation slowly bleeding out of her.  <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0077600 " ,

The blonde was not at all prepared to see her possible new friends fighting, especially so close after her own falling out with her previous awful friends not that long ago. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0078000 " ,

I\'m better off spending time with my friends anyway, and I can\'t do that with other people around. They look at me like I\'m crazy. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0078700 " ,

 " Skye  <br><br> I think we’re all a bit tense right now, maybe this wasn’t such a good idea. I-I’m just gonna go. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0079500 " ,

 " Atria  <br><br> Player’s just worried about you. I-I am too. It’s not right that people’ve made you think that you don’t get to have friends, j-just because you’re a little different. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0080900 " ,

 " Atria  <br><br> You’ve probably gone through a lot of things that\'ve caused you pain. I’ve had to work on my own things recently and I get that it is so… so scary to trust other people after everything. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0082900 " ,
 " Narration  <br><br> The blonde circles the table to move closer to the bespectacled girl, before pulling at their clasped hands, bringing the two closer together. Her eyes shine brightly with unshed tears. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0083200 " ,
 " Atria  <br><br> But, maybe you’d like some help with it? I think we both could use some practice with this friend thing. Why don’t we try this out together? <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0083500 " ,

 " Skye  <br><br> O-okay. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0084400 " ,
 " Narration  <br><br> At this point, you aren’t sure if you should stay in the room. It feels like you’re interrupting something even as the two finally separate, still looking at one another. You finally clear your throat, breaking the two’s reverie, returning their gaze towards you. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0084700 " ,
 " Player  <br><br> Skye, I’m sorry for how I acted. Atria was right, I was worried, but I should’ve been more sensitive. I… shouldn’t have made it about myself. <br><br> _Dialog Code:  Chapter_2_0085000 " ,
