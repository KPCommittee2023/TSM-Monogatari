    "character_object_skye <br><br>Well they didn\'t apologise, but they did look pretty pissed that it was pretty clearly not me ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Skye shrugs faux casually. It\'s difficult to figure out what she\'s thinking. She seems a little bit more closed off than she was this morning ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>Anyway, you don\'t have to worry about those idiots, they\'re way more of a nuisance then they are actually troubling. My class is filled with a lot of kind and friendly people, so their voices get drowned out most of the time ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Skye smiles at you reassuringly, looking up from her previously contemplative pose ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>Now, why don\'t we discuss your club? It\'s what you invited me here for right ",

    "character_object_player <br><br>Umm, not necessarily.. ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Atria looks at you questioningly, moving closer to the table and placing her things on it. She fidgets awkwardly with her things before looking up at Skye, smiling uncertainly towards the taller girl ",

    "character_object_narration <br><br>Atria\'s stumbling responses were sort of expected, but Skye\'s stuttering prompts a raised eyebrow from you, confused at her sudden inarticulateness. Noticing your expression, she huffs indignantly, hissing her next words quietly at you ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>Seeing new faces makes me anxious sometimes! You and your friend definitely caught me off guard this morning.. ",
    "character_object_player <br><br>Oh yeah, you met Kyo this morning. Sorry he couldn\'t be here, he stepped out just now ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>Oh. That\'s fine, I didn\'t bring any of my friends here either. Communication isn\'t easy when other parties can\'t easily talk to or even see one another ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>You laugh awkwardly remembering Skye\'s...friends. It might be a little awkward, navigating Skye\'s...eccentricities, but you feel like it would work out... you might have to invest in a sturdier poker face soon though ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Atria tilts her head in confusion, unaware of all that happened that day ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Skye flushes brightly, before turning back to the now confused but still shyly smiling Atria. She coughs awkwardly, bringing the discussion back to focus ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>Anyway, like I said, I\'m not sure if joining the club would be beneficial for everyone involved. I\'d be happy to help y\'all out in general though, you seem like really nice people, mhm ",

    "character_object_player <br><br>I agree, that\'s kinda why I invited you in the first place. I\'m happy that you\'re willing to help us generally, but honestly, I\'d like you to stick around. I think we\'d all get along great ",

    "character_object_narration <br><br>Skye seems to flinch at your words, her previous light-hearted expression disappearing in an instant. She looks away from you and Atria, clearly uncomfortable. ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Your eyebrows furrow with worry, you share a glance with Atria, who is now frowning as well ",
    "character_object_player <br><br>Can I ask why you... don\'t want to join us? You did mention you hadn\'t signed up for any other club yet, and you don\'t seem to be against the idea in general ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>I-I\'m a very busy woman. I can\'t just start up a new club out of nowhere! After all, who would conduct my campaigns, and.. ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Skye doesn\'t sound convincing, even to herself. She slumps in her chair, sighing tiredly, running her hand through her hair nervously ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>I-It\'d just be easier for all of us. You wouldn\'t have to deal with me too regularly, and we get to go our own ways ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>A short silence comes after her words. You\'re shocked that the cheerful girl from this morning had given you such a self-depreciating answer. Atria, having no basis for the girl\'s personality, shyly answers, noticing the tense mood ",

    "character_object_atria <br><br>either ",

    "character_object_narration <br><br>You appreciate her support in this situation. It helps ground you a little, having someone else\'s perspective on this. Skye shakes her head, dismissing the notion ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>No no, you\'re both really nice, I tend to not work well with others. People tend to be really uncomfortable around me, and even if you didn\'t mind tolerating me, I\'ll just bring the mood down. Clubwork and community stuff like this never really suited me ",

    "character_object_narration <br><br>Your face scrunches at hearing the familiar narrative from this afternoon, discomfort growing at hearing Skye parroting her aggressors ",
    "character_object_player <br><br>Is this about what those people said on break? If it is, I think we should be able to find out on our own whether or not we get along. I know we just met this morning, but I think you\'re pretty great ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>You don\'t get it, everyone gets tired of me eventually. This isn\'t about what those idiots think, it\'s just a fact. I like to keep whatever amicable acquaintances I have and I do that by keeping some distance ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Her voice is wrought with agitation and yours, unfortunately, rises in return. Your discomfort turns to upset at the thought of your possible friend thinking so poorly of herself, and by extension, of everyone else around her ",
    "character_object_player <br><br>I think you\'re being a little unfair here. I\'d be more comfortable with your decision if you just weren\'t sure of the club itself, or if you\'re not comfortable with interacting too closely with what would be veritable strangers ",
    "character_object_player <br><br>But, what\'s happening is that you\'re refusing to give us any credit! You\'re so sure we\'re like those assholes that you won\'t give us a chance to even form our own opinions ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>That\'s not what I\'m saying at all! I\'m just telling you it\'s not gonna work out ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>Maybe it is about those guys, but didn\'t you hear them? I talk weird, I talk too much, I\'m annoying, people can\'t see Pio-chan and the others and they hate it when I talk to \'em. This stuff isn\'t just a them thing! ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Skye\'s arguments, having reached a fever pitch, suddenly tapers off. She looks to your side where Atria is before blowing out a huge sigh, agitation slowly bleeding out of her. ",
    "character_object_atria <br><br>Atria2_Timi ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>You turn to look at Atria, who looks almost frozen in panic. The blonde was not at all prepared to see her possible new friends fighting, especially so close after her own falling out with her previous awful friends not that long ago ",

I\'m better off spending time with my friends anyway, and I can\'t do that with other people around. They look at me like I\'m crazy ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Her joke dies an awkward death. You\'re not ready to meet her eyes and you aren\'t really sure what to say ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>You want to apologise for getting so worked up and for butting in where your opinions may not be wanted, but you don\'t like that she thinks so badly of herself ",
    "character_object_skye <br><br>I think we\'re all a bit tense right now, maybe this wasn\'t such a good idea. I-I\'m just gonna go ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>You whip your head back to her, eyes widening.  You open your mouth to call out and clear things up, but a voice stops you from doing so ",

    "character_object_atria <br><br>W-wait ",

    "character_object_atria <br><br>I know the feeling.. ",

    "character_object_narration <br><br>At this point, you aren\'t sure if you should stay in the room.

You finally clear your throat, breaking the two\'s reverie, returning their gaze towards you ",
    "character_object_player <br><br>Skye, I\'m sorry for how I acted. Atria was right, I was worried, but I should\'ve been more sensitive. I... shouldn\'t have made it about myself ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Skye smiles at you for the apology, moving towards you and extending an arm for you to grab. You gratefully take it, grasping onto her palm to shake. Her mouth quirks up in a rueful smirk ",
