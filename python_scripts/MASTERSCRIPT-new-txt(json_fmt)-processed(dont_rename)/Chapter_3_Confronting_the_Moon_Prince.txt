    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>	And s-so, in middle school, I decided to change things up a bit ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>Grew my hair out, changed my style, learned how to accessorize ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>I learned about social cues, read some comics, watched some movies where the main character undergoes a transformation and suddenly they know how to talk to people, and how to get them to like them ",

    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>	And I liked it, my changes ",

    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>	So, I started going out with some people ",

    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>	Like, whoa, intimate connection? Me ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>And it was okay, but like, some people ended up ending our relationship because I wasn\'t who they thought I was ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>	I mean, who wanted a dinosaur-loving, closete ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>emo-musician guy ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>	But others gave me hope ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>There was a guy I went out with, and he really appreciated me. I felt seen, and loved, genuinely. For the first time in a while ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>We ended up breaking it off because he said his parents were strict ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>	Or at least, that\'s what he said to my face ",

    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>	But then, it went to shit ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>This girl, she was really toxic. As in she didn\'t let me see other people, but she could see a lot of others ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>And she gaslit me often, made me emotionally dependent on her, and my mental health tanked ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>I felt choked, and scared, and honestly, I was really disappointed: in her, myself, and just the humans around me for being so... inhumane ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>I just... wanted to breathe again. So, I left her, left the school I was at, and transferred here. Blocked everyone I knew, and I hoped that I could start anew ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>And I think I did, at least. No one seems to hate me here &mdash; just a lot of admiration. ...But you never know ",
    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>So I wanted to hide everything: never get close to anyone here, never tell anyone my story... but you.. ",

    "character_object_esmeray <br><br>	...Thanks, for listening.. ",
    "character_object_narration <br><br>Looks like you were right: Esmeray didn\'t really have genuine friends of his own, so you decided it was time to change that ",
