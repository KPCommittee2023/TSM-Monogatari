 " Player  Chapter_3_0048500 	I heard that. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0048800 	Nah, you didn’t. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0049100 You playfully glare at him before turning to your own lunch and shifting in your seat. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0049400 I’ll be blunt. I just think you would make a good addition to the club. " ,

 " Narration Esmeray Unamused  Chapter_3_0049700 Esmeray raises his eyebrow at you in disbelief, and his eyes look at you as if asking you, \"Seriously?\" " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0050000 Not only are you very talented in music – which would be helpful to use whenever we do broadcasts – but I think your presence alone would be good publicity for the club. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0050300 	Esmeray scoffs at this, but continues to listen regardless. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0050600 And also, I would like to be friends with you. You seem interesting, and nicer than you show. Although, you need to fix that playboy personality of yours. " ,

 " Esmeray Amused  Chapter_3_0050900 	Pfft– " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0051200 You quickly turn to Esmeray in disbelief, only to find his face contorted into a laughing, genuine smile. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0051500 	Playboy? Me? Nah, das crazy, what do you mean? " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0051700 Like, I thought that’s how you’re supposed to act when you want to make friends? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0052000 	Now it’s your turn to laugh. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0052300 Hah, what? Really? You really thought the best way to socialize with people was to rizz them up? HAHA, that’s HILARIOUS! " ,

 " Esmeray Teeth Smile  Chapter_3_0052600 Wh-WHAT?! NO! I was NOT– rizzing ANYONE! You’re just weird to interpret it that way! " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0052900 	You two continue to laugh and talk more on the rooftop. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0053100 After you finish laughing, you look past the iron fence of the rooftop and at the sky. " ,

 " Esmeray Genuine  Chapter_3_0053300 Esmeray Genuine " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0053600 The sky does look like blue sugar. " ,

 " Narration Esmeray Neutral  Chapter_3_0053900 	Esmeray’s eyes widen, and he whips his head towards you. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0054200 H-Huh? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0054500 I overheard you singing earlier, and also before… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0054700 …Wanna talk about it?  " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0054900 I-I mean, you don’t have to, of course! " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0055100 I was just thinking, I mean, we are friends now, so… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0055300 B-But of course, you don’t have to, a-and if you want to then feel free to take all the time you need, and stuff… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0055500 Esmeray:  " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0055600 	… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0055800 	… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0056000 F…friends? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0056200 … " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0056400 Okay, I do want to say this to someone, at least… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0056700 You patiently wait for him to keep talking. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0056900 After a couple moments of silence, Esmeray clears his throat. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0057200 Ahem… When…… when I was in elementary school, I had a lot of people who thought I was like an alien because I was shorter than the average height and had weird looking ears. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0057400 	And s-so, in middle school, I decided to change things up a bit. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0057600 Grew my hair out, changed my style, learned how to accessorize. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0057800 I learned about social cues, read some comics, watched some movies where the main character undergoes a transformation and suddenly they know how to talk to people, and how to get them to like them. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0058000 	So, I tried some of the lines from the movies and comics out. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0058200 	A-And it worked! People… They started to like me. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0058400 My growth spurt helped me out too – I stood out from the crowd, in a good way. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0058600 All of a sudden, people stopped calling me names like alien boy, weirdo, and bozo, and they called me things like a prince, a cool guy. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0058800 	… " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0059000 	And I liked it, my changes. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0059200 	And I thought it would stay that way, but… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0059500 	… " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0059800 	So, I started going out with some people. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0060000 At first, it was crazy to me: people actually liked me, I was actually someone attractive to them. My ways of communication were working, and stuff.  " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0060200 	Like, whoa, intimate connection? Me? " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0060400 And it was okay, but like, some people ended up ending our relationship because I wasn’t who they thought I was. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0060600 	I mean, who wanted a dinosaur-loving, closeted " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0060700 emo-musician guy? " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0060900 	But others gave me hope! " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0061100 There was a guy I went out with, and he really appreciated me. I felt seen, and loved, genuinely. For the first time in a while. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0061300 We ended up breaking it off because he said his parents were strict. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0061500 	Or at least, that’s what he said to my face. " ,

 " Esmeray  Chapter_3_0061700 	… " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0062000 	… " ,

 " Esmeray Angry  Chapter_3_0062300 …Turns out he was making fun of me to his friends the entire time we were dating. I found out because this girl I knew showed me a video of him talking to her and their other friends. " ,

 " Esmeray Angry  Chapter_3_0062500 I was heartbroken, angry… I mean, how could he blatantly lie to me like that and still be okay? Why… Why was I left with all the negatives? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0062800 You begin to pat Esmeray on the back, seeing him so sad and agitated. He calms down, thanking you quietly. " ,

 " Esmeray Neutral  Chapter_3_0063100 *inhale* Anyways, that girl and I ended up getting close because she told me about how she left the friend group and she was there for me. " ,

 " Esmeray Neutral  Chapter_3_0063300 I healed, and then I thought that maybe she was the one, ya know? " ,

 " Esmeray Angry  Chapter_3_0063600 	But then, it went to shit. " ,

 " Esmeray Angry  Chapter_3_0063800 This girl, she was really toxic. As in she didn’t let me see other people, but she could see a lot of others? " ,

 " Esmeray Angry  Chapter_3_0064000 And she gaslit me often, made me emotionally dependent on her, and my mental health tanked. " ,

 " Esmeray Angry  Chapter_3_0064200 I felt choked, and scared, and honestly, I was really disappointed: in her, myself, and just the humans around me for being so… inhumane. " ,

 " Esmeray Unamused  Chapter_3_0064500 I just… wanted to breathe again. So, I left her, left the school I was at, and transferred here. Blocked everyone I knew, and I hoped that I could start anew. " ,

 " Esmeray Neutral 1  Chapter_3_0064800 And I think I did, at least. No one seems to hate me here – just a lot of admiration. …But you never know. " ,

 " Esmeray Neutral 1  Chapter_3_0065000 So I wanted to hide everything: never get close to anyone here, never tell anyone my story… but you… " ,

 " Esmeray Genuine  Chapter_3_0065300 	You… actually seem to care for me… " ,

 " Esmeray Genuine  Chapter_3_0065500 	…Thanks, for listening… " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0065800 Looks like you were right: Esmeray didn’t really have genuine friends of his own, so you decided it was time to change that. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0066000 	You make direct eye contact with Esmeray. " ,

 " Esmeray Unamused  Chapter_3_0066300 W-What? Are you gonna accuse me of being too edgy now, or something? " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0066600 	Nah. I just wanted to invite you again to the Radio Club. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0066800 I promise we’re all nice people, and I guarantee that we’re not like those people from your past.  " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0067000 You can leave if you don’t feel like staying with us, no strings attached. I think it would be amazing if you join us.  " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0067200 Wanna give it a try? " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0067500 You hold out your hand, ready to receive a handshake in agreement from Esmeray. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0067700 Esmeray stares at your hand, before his own twitches and lifts up to shake it. " ,

 " Narration  Chapter_3_0067900 Your face breaks out into a large smile. The mood immediately becomes more lighthearted. " ,

 " Player  Chapter_3_0068200 	Great! Welcome aboard, Esme! " ,

 " Esmeray Smile  Chapter_3_0068500 	…W-wait, Esme? I did NOT agree to this, what the f– " ,
