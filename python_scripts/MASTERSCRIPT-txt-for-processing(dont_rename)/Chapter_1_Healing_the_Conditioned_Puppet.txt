Chapter 1: Healing the Conditioned Puppet

[School Rooftop Day]
[Atria's BGM]

Narration:
…

The fresh air really is relaxing when there's so much going on. Having to recruit members for a radio club of all things, and so suddenly too… as if that isn’t crazy enough, the amount of drama at the school has been…irritating, to say the least.

Hell, it’s insane. …Those damn rumors that the school is haunted are… unnerving, to say the least.

Player:
…People are so desperate to just get a reaction out of people, huh… at this point I don’t doubt this school’s going to digress into chaos.

Kyo [Kyo_FP_Smiling]:
Chaos? I call it fun!

Player:
WHAT TH–

Kyo:
Have you found any recruits yet?

Player:
…Warn me next time before sneaking up on me, will you??

Kyo [Kyo_FP_Cheerful]:
No thanks.

Narration:
Kyo leans forward, his hands on his hips. His expression screams nothing but smug mockery, plainly amused at your annoyance.

Kyo:
Now, you’ve found someone, right? Surely it can't be so hard to evaluate who here is a good candidate. Not when there are very few people who stand out amongst the rest.

Narration:
He speaks as if he already has certain people in mind. If so, why is he so insistent on you recruiting members as opposed to him?

Player:
No, Kyo, it has quite literally only been a couple hours.

Kyo [Kyo_FP_Bruh]:
Mhm… from the way you’re acting now, I’ve most likely put too much faith in you… I guarantee you’re just too introverted to go up and ask someone to join.

Player:
…Actually, I genuinely haven’t seen anyone who looks suitable. A radio club requires someone who is willing to… well, talk. Right?

Kyo:
Right…

You sure you're not just scared to interact with people?

Player:
Shut up.

Narration:
Jeez. For someone he just met, Kyo sure has some nerve.

Player:
I hate to break it to you, Mr. know-it-all, but I have yet to see anybody who seems talkative. If anything, I’m the most extroverted person here.

Narration [Kyo_FP_Cheerful]:
Kyo just shoots you a cocky grin, rolling his eyes playfully. 

Kyo:
Mhm, very believable. Just be a bit more observant, will you? It really can’t be that difficult to find someone.

Player:
But-

Kyo:
Yeah, yeah. I get it. Your short attention span won't allow you to tune into one person for more than 15 seconds.

Narration:
You scowl at his remark, but your reaction only further enables him to keep poking at you. You didn’t really mind his banter, but at the very least you wish you could have the ability to snap back.

Player:
What do you want me to do? Just sit and observe as someone goes about their day?? Just stand menacingly in some corner and watch them?

Kyo [Kyo_SP_Default]:
No need to make it sound so creepy. Listen, you gotta do what you gotta do. Just don’t make it too obvious. 

Though, from what I’ve seen, I’m starting to even question whether you’re capable of that much.
[Proceed to two choices: <Let it slide> or <Try proving him wrong>]

[Choice 1: Let it slide]

Narration:
Kyo snickers, tilting his head momentarily as if discreetly pointing somewhere. 

Kyo:
I bet you anything if you actually listen you’ll find someone immediately.

Narration:
Your eyes follow the direction of his nudge.

[Scene reconverges here]


[Choice 2: Try proving him wrong]

Narration:
You glance around, searching for someone you can listen in on to make your point.

Your ears pick up on some commotion, and your attention drifts.
		[Scene reconverges here]

[Remove Kyo]
[Atria1_Happy. Darken by 50%, centered]

Narration:
At that moment, you see a group of girls across the courtyard. They all seem rather silent–bored, even– but one of them in particular stands out to you.

???:
Anyways! About the person I was talking about earlier, the one that I frequently watch. They did this one stream recently, it was a collaboration with some of my favorite streamers! When I saw the waiting room for it, I got really excited!

???:
I sent it to you guys a while back, though I’m not sure if you saw it? Neither of you responded… Do you think there's a possibility we could watch it together sometime?

Narration:
The two other girls look at each other before faking a smile towards her direction.

Girl A:
...You’re ranting about these streamers every two seconds, you expect us to know which one you are talking about?

??? [Atria1_Nervous]:
Oh– …Yeah. Sorry. I guess sometimes I just say stuff without really thinking.

??? [Atria2_Happy]:
The one with… let’s see, I'm trying to think of a way to describe this to someone who doesn’t watch them. They have… blue hair. It’s short, around shoulder length. Does that ring a bell?

Narration:
Wait…

Short… blue hair…? That's…

Kind of silly.

???:
I understand if you guys don’t remember! I know I can speak a bit quickly at times.

Oh! Yeah, the one I was talking about yesterday! Surely you remember th–

Girl A:
Hello? Earth to Atria? Atria Aiyashi?

You know, the Atria that thinks before she goes on meaningless tangents? We’re tired of you constantly bothering us about stuff we aren’t interested in.

[Atria2_Nervous]

Narration:
The small yellow haired girl, supposedly named Atria, tenses at the others’ remark. She had been rambling excitedly about her interests just a moment ago and yet… her tone suddenly falters.

Atria:
...A-Ah.. was I too much?..

Girl B:
Atria, you can’t keep forgetting we raised you to be silent.

Atria:
I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to do anything…

Girl B:
It's the same answer every single time. No matter how much we remind you, you go back to your annoying little ‘hyperfixations’.

Surely you can try a bit harder? You’ve been like this for years now. Is there really something stopping you from just… realizing we don’t care?

Take your silly little blue guy and talk about him to yourself, yeah?

Atria [Atria1_Nervous]:
Genuinely, I didn’t mean to do anything…

Girl B:
Do you want us to help you or not?

Atria:
I’m sorry, okay?

Girl B:
We at least had some sort of faith in you. We thought we could change you to stop you from constantly babbling on…but you haven’t even made any ounce of progress.

Girl A:
The only reason we even tolerate you is because we feel bad.

[Atria1_Sad]

Narration:
Atria opens her mouth, as if to speak, but no sound escapes
her.

Her voice is caught, suffocated by the others words and the fear of the repercussions of standing up for herself. Her body language speaks volumes, clearly burdened by the weight of the expectations placed upon her.

In a shaky, pitiful murmur, she chokes out a rebuttal.

Atria:
I-I said I’m sorry, okay?

Narration:
Atria seems to regret speaking up halfway through her argument, audible desperation in her wavering voice. However, it was simply idiotic to think that the two standing next to her would back down so easily.

Girl B:
You really can’t do anything right, can you?

Narration:
The girl at her side clicks her tongue, smiling manipulatively.

Girl B:
We’re nice enough to give you advice, and you can’t even shut up and take it? You’re lucky we even waste our effort on you. 

What happened to the promise you made us? That you’d do what we ask of you? Do you really want a repeat of what happened last time?

Narration:
The third individual reaches upwards, placing a hand on Atria’s shoulder ‘comfortingly’. 

[Atria2_Sad. Make sprite jump in surprise]

This only causes Atria to flinch and instinctively put her hands
up in defense.

Girl A:
...We’ll take that reaction as a no.

Girl A:
Remember, we're your only friends. We're really just trying to
do you a favor.

Atria:
…

Narration:
There is a hesitation that lasts for what seems like an eternity, as Atria’s expression fades. Her emotion is lacking in comparison to mere seconds ago. It seems forced, for sure, yet it's clear she’s putting significant effort into holding this mask.

Atria [Atria2_Timid]:
…Yeah, thank you for reminding me.

Narration:
She lowers her gaze, attempting with all her will to keep a strong, emotionless veil. This would have been manageable for the time being, but the two others don’t even respond to her submission.

They just… stare. 

Stare as she attempts to keep her composure.

Atria:
…

Atria:
…

[Atria2_Sad – only shown momentarily before she disappears]
[Footstep SFX]

Kyo [FP_Shocked, centered]:
…

Kyo:
Das crazy.

Player:
…That's really all you have to say?

[Kyo_FP_Smiling]

Narration:
Kyo looks at you with an obvious smugness, outwardly unphased by… whatever had just happened between those three. 

Kyo:
I told you if you actually took the time to tune into a conversation, it wouldn’t be so hard to find someone.

Player:
What, do you want me to go get her and ask her to join a radio club after that?

Narration:
His eyes flicker, looking at the school door where Atria had run off to, then back at you.

Back… and forth… and back… and–

Kyo:
So… are you gonna just sit there? Seriously?

Player:
Wh–

Kyo:
Are you even gonna do something? Or nah?

Narration:
Kyo looks at you, like he wants you to go run after her. It’s… oddly ominous. Like he just wants an excuse to make you speak with Atria. …Does he know her or something? Is that what this was all about??

[Proceed to two choices: <Ignore the whole incident> or <Go search for Atria>]

[Choice 1: Ignore the whole incident]

Player:
I really don’t think I should interfere…

[Kyo_FP_Bruh]

Narration:
Kyo stares at you with a tinge of concern.

Kyo:
…Don’t you think she would be a good candidate for the radio club? …Can’t you just… tell?

Narration:
He clearly knows more than he's letting on… his consistently unsettling statements are starting to stand out more and more…

Eh, surely it's nothing. There's no way this guy can do anything, anyways.

Player:
What is she, the ‘chosen one’ or something?

Narration:
You joke, rolling your eyes.

[Scene reconverges here]

[Choice 2: Go search for Atria]
[Scene reconverges here]

Player:
Fine, fine. Let’s go find her, alright?

Kyo [Kyo_FP_Bruh]:
...Actually, I think you should go on your own. I… will only get
in the way.

Narration:
He speaks in an eerie tone, as if he’s admitting to something.
What on earth is up with him?

Player:
…Okay? So… you just want me to convince her to join?

Wait, what do you mean by ‘get in the way’?? 

…

Actually, nevermind. I can see it.

[Kyo sprite is removed]

Narration:
You look at the school building momentarily, sighing. It’s an irritating reality, but the longer you wait, the harder it will be to find her.

Player:
I guess I’ll see you later then-

Narration:
You look back to where Kyo had stood just a moment ago, your eyes only meeting blank space.

Player:
Huh?

Narration:
…He never fails to do something strange, does he?

You figure you should just get moving.


[Transition to School Classroom Day]

Narration:
…

Alright then, she has to be somewhere around here.

Player:
Atria? Hello?

Narration:
… 

Silence.

Player:
Atria? Don’t worry… I’m not gonna yell.

[Atria1_Sad]
[Centered]

Narration:
You glance around, scanning the room, your eyes spotting a fragile figure hunched in the corner. The eye contact causes her body to tense, as if she were expecting judgment, or ridicule.

Atria:
…W-why do you… know my name…?

Narration:
Atria speaks between quiet sobs, her voice strained with emotion. She’s vulnerable, her guard shattered from the weight of her own struggles.

Player:
I… overheard your conversation earlier.

Narration:
You take a few steps towards her, careful not to invade her space. Despite your carefulness, she pushes herself against the walls, making herself appear as small and insignificant as possible.

Atria:
D-did they send you here… to deal with me…?

Narration:
Her voice drips with anticipation. Anticipation to be met with some sort of pain, whether it be emotional or physical.

Player:
No– it’s nothing of the sort. My name is Player… It… must be really exhausting having to listen to their torment.

Do they constantly tell you things like that?

Atria:
I-…

Narration:
Atria hesitates, unsure whether she should even respond to such a question.

Atria:
They… they just want what’s best for me. They’ve been my friends for a long time.	

Narration:
…

If you were to disregard the scene that had taken place earlier, her self-assured words would seem genuine. 

She's noticeably frustrated, like she's trying to convince you to believe in her words. Has she really been tricked into thinking she's at fault? To the point she would stand up for those so-called ‘friends’?

Player:
How long, exactly, have they been your friends?

Narration:
Your tone is soft, encouraging her to open up. Even so, her eyes dart around, desperately seeking for anywhere to look except your own gaze.

Atria:
…As long as I remember. Really, I’m serious… they’re just
trying to deal with me.

Player:
Don’t you think they are being a bit… ah, harsh?

[Atria2_Sad]

Narration:
You observe Atria closely, noticing the conflict within her as she struggles with her loyalty to her ‘friends’ and their effect on her emotional stability. She seems torn, caught between the conflicting beliefs instilled by her ‘friends’ and the flickers of doubt emerging within her.

She speaks, her voice laced with a forced conviction.

Atria:
It's… fine. I’m used to it.

Narration:
…Used to it?

You struggle for a good moment, before a realization hits you; her perception of reality has been shaped by years of… whatever they had done to her.

Comforting and giving advice wasn’t exactly your strong suit...

Player:
Atria… that's not normal.

Atria [Atria2_Timid]:
Huh?

Narration:
She takes a few seconds to herself, a mix of confusion and curiosity seeping through her expression. You take the silence as an opportunity to explain and clear up any possible questions.

Player:
What I mean is, friends are meant to encourage your hobbies, and allow you to open up about yourself. What I saw back there wasn’t healthy… nor acceptable.

Narration:
You speak with a confident tone, pushing aside your own uncertainties on how to navigate such a sensitive conversation. The more you speak, however, the more confusion crosses Atrias face.

Atria:
But… that's how it’s always been. It's been like that for as
long as I remember.

Narration:
The confusion of the whole situation only proved the depth of her conditioning.

The dynamics you had witnessed between her and her so-called ‘friends’ seem to be ingrained in her entire understanding of relationships. It blurs the line of what she depicts as acceptable or not. 

Player:
Do you mind explaining to me what your friends have been like towards you? Perhaps I can get a better insight on what exactly is going on.

I… understand if you don’t want to share. Though it really could help me evaluate who’s in the wrong.

Atria [Atria1_Timid]:
…I would, but… they don’t really like me talking to other
people…

…But… the way you are talking to me completely contradicts the things that they have said would happen if I did…

Narration:
Atria mumbles, taking in a deep breath as she contemplates whether or not she should open up.

Atria:
…Alright, just– please don’t tell them I said anything. Nobody… has ever, er… offered this to me, so… I’m not really sure how they would react if they found out.

Narration:
You nod, reassuring her.

Player:
I wouldn’t dream of it.

Narration:
Atria visibly relaxes, her tense posture softening slightly as she starts to consider sharing her experiences. It's a step into the unknown for her. 

Atria:
Okay, just… give me a moment. 

Narration:
She takes a deep breath, steadying herself as she gathers the courage to break the chains of silence that have bound her for so long.

[Atria1_Nervous]

A weak smile forms as she reminisces.

Atria:
I met them in 2nd grade, and they were the first people in my life that would actually call me a friend. …They never really liked me hanging out with others. So, since then, I’ve just kind of stuck with them.

They helped me, and they still help me to this day. The least I can do for them is follow a couple orders here and there. …I don’t exactly know what would happen if I didn’t do as they asked, anyways. There's no use putting up too much of a fight.

Narration:
A small, breathless laugh leaves her, but it seems rather simulated.

Atria:
They remind me when I speak too much, and push me to improve myself. They put up with me, even now, after years of not being able to keep to myself.

[Atria1_Timid]

Narration:
Atria’s expression fades as she takes a moment to think about what she had just said. Quietly, she repeats her words to herself.

Atria:
…Years.

Atria:
I’m… lucky they even stick around.

Narration:
Her words are solemn, yet she accepts this idea as the truth with no troubles. You shake your head.

Player:
I… I can’t know exactly what your life has been like, but from what I saw back there, they… really don’t seem like they are doing this for your sake. 

I can understand it's difficult to accept this, especially since you haven’t been exposed to kinder relationships.

However, isolating you from others and demanding obedience is not a healthy dynamic. You have individuality, and it shouldn’t be suppressed.

Narration:
You emphasize the qualities of healthy relationships, hoping your words impact her twisted definition of a friend.

[Atria2_Timid]

She looks up in thought, finding it difficult to grasp the foreign concept that her ‘friends’ actions may not align with true friendship.

Atria:
But… they've always said it's for my own good. That their guidance and control are necessary to make me better. Isn’t… that how friends are supposed to be?

Narration:
You look at her questioningly, wondering how exactly you could explain this to her when her thought process had been so warped and muddled.

Player:
…Here, imagine this; a friendship where you are allowed to express yourself freely, and your thoughts and feelings are valued. 

Narration:
Atria's eyes widen, fascinated in the allure of this alternate reality.

[Atria1_Timid]

Atria:
…Are you sure… that’s really possible?

Narration:
You nod, offering her your hand. She reluctantly takes it, standing.

Player:
...I understand if you don’t believe me, but hey, why not try it out?

Atria [Atria2_Timid]:
…

…I-I’m scared…

…What are they going to think?

Narration:
You look at her with solemn eyes, acknowledging the severity of her situation.

[Proceed to two choices: <Tell her to confront them?> or <Tell her to take her time>]

[Choice 1: Tell her to confront them]

Player:
Atria, I understand your attachment to them, but a lot of their actions that you’ve explained to me don’t seem right in any way..

If you think they are causing you hurt, the best thing to do is confront them as soon as possible.

If they disregard your feelings after you do so, they aren’t worth your time. Let alone your pain.

I know it may be hard, but sometimes cutting people out of your life is the best decision. It can be the difference between differing sides of your mental stability.

Narration:
Atrias eyes widen at this, fearing the mere idea of confrontation.

Atria:
…But what if they respond negatively…?

[Atria2_Sad]

Atria:
What if they…

Narration:
She flinches, seemingly reimagining older events. Taking a deep breath, she composes herself. It was a blatant lie, a response that seems like a natural reflex to recalling such things.

[Atria1_Timid]

Atria:
…I… don’t think that’s a good idea.

[Scene reconverges here]

[Choice 2: Tell her to take her time]

Player:
Don’t worry too much about it. I’ll help you through this, and you can take as much time as you need.

It's a large step to take, and it can take a lot. I encourage you to take your time.

…Just, think about what's best for you. Consider the idea of friends that allow you to just be yourself.

Narration:
Slowly, Atria nods in agreement.

[Atria1_Timid]

Atria:
I… I don’t really know… I’ve known them for so long…
[Scene reconverges here]

Atria:
But…

[Atria1_Nervous]

I can try.

Narration:
You smile at her efforts.

Player:
I’ll be here whenever you need me, okay?

Well… of course I’m not always here but- My point is, if you need help, don’t worry about asking for it.

[Atria2_Nervous]

Narration:
Atria nods, which you take as a cue to leave.

…

But upon turning around…

[Atria sprite is removed]

[Kyo_FP_Bruh - Appears before dialogue box]

Player:
K–

Holy BONKERS will you stop doing that–

Kyo:
Oh, come on. I’m not that scary.

Anyways, will you stop forgetting why you even talked to her in the first place??

Narration:
Oh, right. The radio club.

Player:
Well– you’re here now, so why don’t you do it?

Kyo:
...She’s waaay more likely to listen to you, you’re the one that was persuading her to do a load of other things.

Player:
Sounds like an excuse to me. You’re pretty good at
blabbering, you two could get along.

Narration:
Kyo reaches his hand out to push you back towards Atria, but stops mid-way, pulling his hand back, and letting out a long sigh before gesturing to her.

Kyo [Kyo_FP_Default]:
Go on.

[Atria2_Nervous]
[Kyo left, Atria right]

Player:
…Sorry about that.

Narration:
Atria looks towards you with blatant confusion.

Player:
I was just wondering if you’re interested in clubs at all? It’ll be a perfect opportunity to get yourself out there and make new friends.

I was hoping to recruit you to the radio club. There, you’ll be able to go on tangents without being judged. I think you’ll fit the role perfectly, and hey, you could maybe help recruit some new members too…?

[Atria2_Timid]

Atria:
Ah… you’re sure I won’t come off as annoying? Y’know… talking and such?

Player:
Of course not. The entire point of a radio club is to speak into a microphone. You can even take it for a little test run, if you’d like.

Atria:
...

W-well… I suppose it’s the least I can do… you’ve kind of helped me consider possibilities I would have never even imagined otherwise…

Narration:
There’s a brief pause before Atria clings to your sleeve, allowing you to lead the way.

[Sprites are removed - momentarily for background transition]

[Music_Room_Basic + Music_Printer]

[Kyo_SP_Default]
[Atria1_Timid]
[Kyo left, Atria right]

Player:
Here’s the club room! Cozy, isn’t it?

[Kyo_FP_Smiling]

Narration:
Kyo speaks, his tone strung with an obvious sarcasm.

Kyo:
Wooow… 32/10 persuasive skills.

Narration: 
You just shoot a glare at him before sighing and moving on.

Player:
Well, how about you step up to the microphone and try it out? Sound good?

Narration:
Atria reluctantly approaches the microphone at the back of the studio, looking at you for approval before switching it on, tapping its end unsurely. 

She has to lower it a bit in order to reach it properly… heh, that would make two short people in the club.

Atria:
...Ah… what should I say?

Player:
Hmm..

Narration:
You look at Kyo for an answer, but you only receive a shrug in response.

Player:
...I guess whatever you feel like. It’s just a test, so, how about something you’re passionate about?

Kyo:
Yeah, that works. Just whatever is easy to talk about.

[Kyo sprite is removed]
[Atria2_Timid]
[Centered]

Narration:
Atria approaches the mic, a bit tense. She starts off very reluctant, stuttering over her sentences.

Atria:
...Hello, I-I’m Atria… um..

...

...

Player:
Hey, it's alright. Just say whatever comes naturally, it doesn’t have to be thought out like some perfect script.

Narration:
Her eyes shift towards your direction, and she takes a deep breath before continuing.

[Atria2_Nervous]

Narration:
Slowly, her body relaxes a little, as she lets go of her worries for a fleeting moment. It takes a little longer for her to grow comfortable with purposely being so outspoken like this.

[Atria sprite is removed]

[Black screen]

She continues speaking, slowly but surely becoming more confident as she speaks her mind, whatever small bits of information or passion that come to her.

Some time passes, and not long later, she begins speaking like she had been waiting for this opportunity for years.

[Atrias club room CG]

Her face lights up with the most genuine smile you have seen from her since the two of you met. You and Kyo give each other accomplished glances, allowing her to ramble without being ridiculed for what seems like the first time in her life.

She seems like an entirely different person, babbling about whatever comes to her mind, in a world of her own.

Even a few giddy sounding giggles manage to leave Atria. It was clear as day that she found enjoyment in this.

Though after a fleeting moment, she stops, making eye contact as if just remembering there are people listening to her. Her eyes widen slightly, but a small smile remains on her expression.

Atria:
...Are you sure this is okay?.. Not suppressing the urge to talk… it feels so different.

Kyo:
...

...Damn she’s traumatized.

Narration:
You try to nudge Kyo, as this was most definitely *not* the time, but he ducks away.

Player:
Of course it’s alright. So, what do you say? Why don’t you try making some friends by helping start up a club?

Atria:
...I–

Narration:
Atria ponders this suggestion, taking a while to push away any troubles with her ‘friends’.

She shakes her head, clearing her mind before nodding with a newfound assurance.

Atria:
I think I’d like that.
